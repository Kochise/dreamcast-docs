Basic Shell Extension


The SHELLEXT sample demonstrates how to implement the basic shell 
extensions. These include context menu, property sheet, icon handler, and 
copy hook extensions. This sample does not implement a drag-drop handler, 
but the implementation would be very similar to context menu handlers.
