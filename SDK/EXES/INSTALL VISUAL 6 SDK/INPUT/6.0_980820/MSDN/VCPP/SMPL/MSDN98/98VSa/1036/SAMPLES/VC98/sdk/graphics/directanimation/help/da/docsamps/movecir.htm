   // This script draws a red circle that moves in a straight line. It starts at the beginning of the line,
   // waits 1 seconds, and then starts to move. It goes from the beginning of the line to end in 4 seconds.
   // It repeats these actions 3 times and then stops at the end.

   // All our measurements will be in pixels, so we use the PixelLibrary

   // The variable "l" is shorthand for the DAStatics Library. Every function that is in that library 
   // (most of them!) needs to be preceded by an "l" so the interpreter knows where to find them
   
     l = DAViewer.PixelLibrary;

   
   // Now construct a red circle
  
   // First set the color that will fill the inside of the circle to red
   fill = l.SolidColorImage(l.Red);

   // Now draw a circle. A circle is an oval whose radius along the x-axis is the same
   // as its radius along the y-axis

   ovalImg = l.Oval(50, 50).Fill(l.DefaultLineStyle, fill);

   // Now construct a straight path that the circle will travel along

   // Our path is a line, and lines are defined by their starting and ending points
   startingPoint = l.Point2(25, 50);
   endingPoint = l.Point2(150, 50);

   // Now make the line (in this case, it isn't drawn on the screen -- it's a guide for the circle)

   myPath = l.Line(startingPoint, endingPoint);

   
   // Define the instruction that will tell the circle where to begin

   // To translate something means to move it. If you want to move something, you need to know where
   // it's going. In this case we want to move the circle to "startingPoint". Because we are defining the
   // place we want to go as a point, we use the Translate2Point function. There are other Translate functions
   // for different ways of expressing where to place something.

   // The Duration function means to wait for 1 seconds at the location we've defined. So, to sum up, this says:
   // "Go to the starting point and wait 1 seconds" (Note that it doesn't need the l in front of it. That's because
   // a Translate2 returns a DATransform2 and that kind of object has the Duration function in its own class. 
 
   goToStart = l.Translate2Point(startingPoint).Duration(1);

   // Now we'll define the instruction that will tell the circle to follow the path:
   // The FollowPath function does exactly what it's name says and it defines how long it should take to go
   // from one end of the path to the other.
   // Here we're saying, follow myPath and go from the beginning to end in 4 seconds. Do this 3 times

   followRoute = l.FollowPath(myPath, 4).Repeat(3);

   
   // Next, we'll combine the two instructions. 

   combineMovements = l.Sequence(goToStart, followRoute);

   // Finally, we need to tell the circle our instructions
   // We're transforming our static drawing of a circle into one that moves along a path.

   movingCircle = ovalImg.Transform(combineMovements);

   
   // Now tell the DAViewer what image to display (our moving circle)
   DAViewer.Image = movingCircle;

   // Finally, give it the go-ahead
   DAViewer.Start();
