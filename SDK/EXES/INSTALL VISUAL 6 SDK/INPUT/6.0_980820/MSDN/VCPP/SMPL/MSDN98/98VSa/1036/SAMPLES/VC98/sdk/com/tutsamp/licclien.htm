<h2><a name="LICCLIEN">LICCLIEN - Client Application of Licensed Server</a></h2>

<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
The LICCLIEN sample examines how a client application uses licensed
components provided by a COM server. LICCLIEN works with the COM servers
of two previous samples, LICSERVE and DLLSERVE. It manipulates a set of
components similar to those presented in DLLCLIEN: COCar, COUtilityCar,
COLicCruiseCar, and COUtilityCruiseCar. In this lesson, the COCar and
COUtilityCar components are obtained, as they were in DLLCLIEN, from the
DLLSERVE server. This sample, however, uses a new licensed version of the
COCruiseCar component that was presented in DLLSERVE and DLLCLIEN. This
licensed component, COLicCruiseCar, is housed in a different server,
LICSERVE.

<P>
Like DLLCLIEN, LICCLIEN.EXE creates its own COUtilityCruiseCar COM object,
which is constructed by reusing the licensed COLicCruiseCar COM object by
aggregation and augmenting it with a native IUtility interface. Because
the COLicCruiseCar COM object class is a licensed aggregatable component,
LICCLIEN illustrates nested aggregation involving a licensed component.

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of LICCLIEN, see the
Code Tour section in LICCLIEN.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of LICCLIEN, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
LICCLIEN.HTM. To read LICCLIEN.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the LICCLIEN lesson in the table of lessons. You can
also achieve the same thing by clicking the LICCLIEN.HTM file after
locating the main tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also
LICSERVE.HTM in the main tutorial directory for more details on how
LICSERVE works and exposes its services to LICCLIEN. You must build the
LICSERVE DLL before building LICCLIEN. The makefile for LICSERVE
automatically registers that server in the system registry, so you must
build LICSERVE before attempting to run LICCLIEN.

<P>
For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

<P>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>LICCLIEN.EXE is an application that you can execute directly from
Windows in the normal manner or from the Command Prompt window. No command
line parameters are recognized by LICCLIEN.

<h4>Run the Sample</h4>

<p>
The client sample and other related samples must be compiled before
you can run the client. For more details on building the samples, see
<a href="using.htm#building">
Building the Code Samples.</a>

<P>
If you have already built the appropriate samples, LICCLIEN.EXE is the
client executable to run for this sample.

<a href="LICCLIEN\LICCLIEN.exe">
Click here to run LICCLIEN.EXE.</a>

<P>
Depending on the security level of your browser you may see a dialog
allowing you to either open the .EXE file or save it to disk. Click the
"Open it" choice and then click the OK button.

<p>&#160;
<h3>OPERATION</h3>

<P>
The LICCLIEN.EXE application provides the user interface for this lesson.
It exercises the components in the associated, but independent,
LICSERVE.DLL and DLLSERVE.DLL servers. Here is a summary of operation from
the standpoint of LICCLIEN.EXE as a COM client of the licensed component
COLicCruiseCar in the LICSERVE.DLL COM server.

<P>
The COM objects that are used in the LICCLIEN and LICSERVE code samples
represent sport utility vehicles. We invent some basic feature sets for
modeling such car objects. These feature sets are implemented as interfaces
to COM objects. The ICar interface provides some basic car behavior: Shift,
Clutch, Speed, and Steer. The IUtility interface provides off-road utility
systems: Offroad and Winch. The ICruise interface provides automatic cruise
control facilities: Engage and Adjust.

<P>
The COCar and COUtilityCar components are constructed and housed in
servers in the manner presented in the DLLCLIEN and DLLSERVE lessons. A
COLicCruiseCar component is constructed using aggregation and is
implemented as a licensed component in LICSERVE.DLL. COUtilityCruiseCar is
constructed using aggregation and is implemented in LICCLIEN.EXE, which is
built in this lesson. COUtilityCruiseCar reuses LicCruiseCar by
aggregation to illustrate nested aggregation of a licensed component.

<P>
The menu system of LICCLIEN provides functionality similar to that of
DLLCLIEN. The Car and UtilityCar menu operations are the same as those
presented in DLLCLIEN and will not be detailed here. We will tour the
internal operation of the LicCruiseCar and the UtilityCruiseCar menus. To
simulate behavior when a component is unlicensed, we will also examine some
changes made to the Log menu.

<P>
LICCLIEN.EXE provides menus for creating, releasing, and invoking methods
for four components: COCar, COUtilityCar, COLicCruiseCar, and
COUtilityCruiseCar. These objects have combinations of the ICar, IUtility,
and ICruise interfaces. COCar objects expose the ICar interface.
COUtilityCar objects expose the ICar and IUtility interfaces. COLicCruiseCar
objects expose the ICar and ICruise interfaces. COUtilityCruiseCar objects
expose the ICar, ICruise, and IUtility interfaces. As a result, COCar
objects have only the basic car behavior (ICar). COUtilityCar objects have
basic car behavior (ICar) with sport utility systems (IUtility).
COLicCruiseCar objects have basic car behavior (ICar) with an automatic
cruise control system (ICruise). COUtilityCruiseCar objects have basic car
behavior (ICar), a cruise control system (ICruise), and a sport utility
system (IUtility).

<P>
LICCLIEN.EXE presents a menu for each of these four main components. Each
menu has commands that call the methods of the various available interfaces.
The code samples (both LICCLIEN and LICSERVE) have trace message log
statements throughout. When you exercise the objects from LICCLIEN.EXE, the
main LICCLIEN window will display a log of internal activity in these
components and their servers.

 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This code sample is based on the code in DLLCLIEN, which is based on the
code in COMUSER, which is based on the code in DLLUSER, which in turn is
based on the code in EXESKEL. See the code tours in those samples for more
details on using the application skeleton and the DLLs.

<P>
LICCLIEN uses many of the utility classes and services provided by
APPUTIL. For more details on APPUTIL, study the APPUTIL library source
code in the sibling APPUTIL directory and APPUTIL.HTM in the main tutorial
directory.

<P>
LICCLIEN illustrates what must be done in the client application to use a
licensed component from a COM server. We will use LICCLIEN to demonstrate
the use of licensed and unlicensed components, and we will examine trace
logs of internal activity in various situations.

<P>
We start in LICCLIEN.CPP. The following files are included, one of which
is new for this code sample.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
  #include &lt;ole2.h&gt;
  #include &lt;initguid.h&gt;
  #include &lt;olectl.h&gt;
  #include &lt;commdlg.h&gt;
  #include &lt;apputil.h&gt;
  #include &lt;icars.h&gt;
  #include &lt;carguids.h&gt;
  #include &quot;licclien.h&quot;
  #include &quot;utcrucar.h&quot;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Because this module is going to implement IClassFactory2, we must make
appropriate declarations by including OLECTL.H. This file should be
included after OLE2.H and INITGUID.H. OLECTL.H was not part of early
releases of the Platform SDK, but instead was part of the Control
Development Kit (CDK). In recent releases, OLECTL.H is part of the
Platform SDK.

<P>
As in the previous DLLCLIEN code sample, we include ICARS.H, located in
the sibling \INC directory, to get the car-related interface abstract base
class declarations. We include CARGUIDS.H, also located in the sibling
\INC directory, for the associated GUID definitions and the CLSIDs for the
car-related component types (CLSID_DllCar, CLSID_DllUtilityCar,
CLSID_LicCruiseCar, CLSID_LicCarSample, and CLSID_DllCarSample).

<P>
The LICCLIEN application's InitInstance method has some interesting points.

<P>
After the CMainWindow is created and the MsgBox facility is initialized,
trace logging is set up for two servers using their respective CarSample
components, LicCarSample and DllCarSample. We store pointers to the
ISample interfaces on these components in the corresponding CMainWindow
member variables, m_pLicCarSample and m_pDllCarSample. The ISample::Init
methods are then called to set up logging from those servers to this
client's logging display. The g_pMsgLog value is passed in the calls to
Init. By creating these CarSample components as COM object instances, the
LICSERVE and DLLSERVE servers are loaded early during execution of the
InitInstance method. This is similar to the behavior of DLLCLIEN; however,
in this lesson we'll have reason to force these servers to be unloaded.
More on this later, when we look at the new selections in the Log menu.

<P>
The CMainWindow::DoMenu method in LICCLIEN.CPP contains the code for the
Car and UtilityCar menus. This code is identical to the corresponding
menu code in DLLCLIEN and in fact operates identically, because it
exercises components in DLLSERVE. The LicCruiseCar menu code takes the
same form as the code for the CruiseCar menu in DLLCLIEN, but when
CoCreateInstance is called, the class factory for the LicCruiseCar
component in the LICSERVE server is invoked.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">

  // Call COM service to create an instance.
  hr = CoCreateInstance(
         CLSID_LicCruiseCar,
         NULL,
         CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER,
         IID_IUnknown,
         (PPVOID)&amp;m_pLicCruiseCar);

      m_pMsgBox-&gt;ErrorID(IDS_NOLICENSE);
  }

<P>
Though this code looks the same in LICCLIEN as it did in DLLCLIEN, the
server code that it executes is different. The LicCruiseCar class factory
in LICSERVE implements IClassFactory2, not IClassFactory. The
CoCreateInstance function will therefore call
IClassFactory2::CreateInstance to check for a valid machine license. If
the LICSERVE server did not detect a valid machine license on
initialization, the CoCreateInstance call in LICCLIEN would fail,
returning CLASS_E_NOTLICENSED, and an error message would be displayed to
indicate that the requested component is not licensed.

<P>
The UtilityCruiseCar menu has several new menu items: Get License Key,
Clear License Key, and Create with Key. The license key being used here
controls creation of the COLicCruiseCar component and not the
COUtilityCruiseCar object itself. The COUtilityCruiseCar COM object is
created in this client as an object that aggregates the COLicCruiseCar
component provided by the LICSERVE server. We will look at each of these
menu items in turn. Here is Get License Key:

<P>
The CoGetClassObject COM API function obtains the IClassFactory2 interface
on the class factory for the COLicCruiseCar component. This class factory
resides in the LICSERVE server. Upon obtaining the interface, we call the
IClassFactory2::RequestLicKey method to obtain the license key. We cache
this license key string for later use by the
IClassFactory2::CreateInstanceLic method.

<P>
The Clear License Key on the UtilityCruiseCar menu simply frees the string
that was obtained above.

The Create with Key menu item passes the license key string to the
CreateUtilityCruiseCar function. If creation fails because the string
does not match the internal license key string (the function returns

<P>
The COUtilityCruiseCar object is made by creating and aggregating a
LicCruiseCar component. Why aggregation? Because the CreateUtilityCruiseCar
function that was called in the code for the Create with Key command passed
a NULL for the first pUnkOuter argument. That NULL pointer was eventually
passed to this Init method, where the logic assigns to pUnkOuter the 'this'
pointer of the COUtilityCruiseCar object itself. This pUnkOuter is then
passed to the CreateInstanceLic method. The CoGetClassObject COM API
function is called to obtain the IClassFactory2 interface of the class
factory for CLSID_LicCruiseCar. The CreateInstanceLic method of this
interface is then called to create the aggregated COLicCruiseCar COM object.
At this point, we don't really need to know that the LICSERVE server
provides this COLicCruiseCar object.

<P>
We are now ready to tour some trace logs of internal behavior. This lesson
demonstrates two kinds of licensing behavior. The first creates a
machine-licensed component by calling the IClassFactory::CreateInstance
method. We saw in the code above that the class factory for COLicCruiseCar
implements IClassFactory2, whose CreateInstance method can create a
component only if the server has found a valid machine license.

<P>
The second acquires a run-time license and later uses it to create a
COUtilityCruiseCar component. We'll look at both licensing scenarios
internally in the following trace logs.

<P>
Here is the trace for the Create command on the LicCruiseCar menu:

<P>
First, notice the new 'P:' indicator. Because we're using nested aggregated
components from two different servers, we use a different trace log code for
each server: 'S:' for behavior inside DLLSERVE and 'P:' for behavior inside
the protected LICSERVE. As in previous trace logs, we retain the 'C:' for
behavior in the Client.

<P>
We'll break this trace sequence into pieces for easier reading:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">

When the client calls CoGetClassObject, the COM implementation locates
the server for the class factory and asks the server (using the server's
DllGetClassObject function) for the IClassFactory interface to the class
factory. In this case, we see the LICSERVE log event indicating that the
CFLicCruiseCar factory is requested. This means that LICSERVE is loaded.
The constructors of both the new CFLicCruiseCar COM object and its nested
implementation of the IClassFactory interface are executed. The CServe
server control object for LICSERVE increments its object count to 2.
This counts the LicCarSample object that supports logging and the new
CFLicCruiseCar COM object. As the CFLicCruiseCar COM object is created,
we see the QueryInterface call on the requested output pointer
(pIClassFactory) and the resultant call to AddRef on that pointer.

<P>
Next, COM calls CreateInstance on the IClassFactory interface. This
results in an unconditional call to CreateLicCruiseCar. We saw in the
LICSERVE lesson that the class factory for COLicCruiseCar took licensing
into account, and calls to its CreateInstance method would succeed only if
the machine license was verified. In this example, creation is successful,
because a valid machine license was found when LICSERVE was initially
loaded.

<P>
The CreateLicCruiseCar method proceeds, and the constructors for the
COLicCruiseCar COM object are executed. The LICSERVE server increments
its object count to 3.

Because COLicCruiseCar aggregates a COCar object, the COLicCruiseCar::Init
method must call CoCreateInstance to create this inner component. The
server managing COCar components is DLLSERVE, so 'S:' appears at the
beginning of these log entries. DllGetClassObject is called, and the CFCar
class factory COM object is created. For this server, the object count is
only 2: counting the DllCarSample object and the new class factory object.
QueryInterface and AddRef are called on the returned IClassFactory
interface.

COM uses the obtained IClassFactory interface to call the CreateInstance
method. The COCar COM object is created in DLLSERVE: the constructors are
executed, the server's object count is incremented to 3, and
QueryInterface and AddRef are called on the new COM object. When
CreateInstance returns, COM releases the IClassFactory interface. The
reference count of CFCar is decremented to 0, the server's object count is
decremented to 2, and the CFCar object's destructors are executed as the
class factory is destroyed. The final DLLSERVE object count is 2, one for
the new COCar object and one for the DllCarSample utility object.

Execution returns to the COLicCruiseCar::Init method, and the new COCar
object is successfully aggregated. Creation of the COLicCruiseCar object
continues with calls to QueryInterface and AddRef on the object's
IUnknown. The COLicCruiseCar has been successfully created. The
IClassFactory interface on CFLicCruiseCar is released, decrementing its
reference count to 0. As a result, the CFLicCruiseCar class factory is
destroyed, and the object count of the LICSERVE server is decremented to
2: one for the new COLicCruiseCar object and one for the COLicCarSample
utility object.

<P>
At this point, the LICCLIEN client has successfully requested that a
COLicCruiseCar object be created, and it has obtained a pointer to that
object's IUnknown interface.

<P>
The matching release of this IUnknown interface is straightforward.
Here's the log after the user chooses the Release command from LICCLIEN's
LicCruiseCar menu:

<P>
In LICSERVE, the COLicCruiseCar object's IUnknown reference is decremented
to 0, causing the object to be deleted. The server decrements its object
count to 1. The destructor of COLicCruiseCar is executed, and the
IUnknown of the COCar object is released, decrementing its reference count
to 0. The object count of the DLLSERVE server is now decremented to 1, and
the destructors for the COCar COM object are executed. Control returns to
the LICSERVE server, and the destructor of the COLicCruiseCar object is
called. After all this, CoFreeUnusedLibraries is called, and this
function calls each server's DllCanUnloadNow function. The servers won't
be unloaded, because each has an object count of 1: for the CarSample
utility component.

The next topic of internal study is run-time licensing. To simulate
run-time licensing, menu items in both the UtilityCruiseCar menu and
the Log menu of LICCLIEN will be used. The simulation sequence is as
follows:

<ol>
<li>Start LICCLIEN.EXE.

<li>From the UtilityCruiseCar menu, choose Get License Key.
   This causes the client to acquire the server's license key and to save
   this value (simulating a persistent saving of it).

<li>In the Command Prompt window, rename the LICSERVE server's machine
   license file. For example, rename LICSERVE.LIC to L.LIC.
   This action effectively hides the license file.

<li>From the Log menu, choose Lic Server. Repeat this step to achieve
   an unload and then reload of the LICSERVE server..
   If the LICSERVE server has only the LicCarSample object, which
   supports logging activity, the Lic Server command loads or unloads
   the LICSERVE server. When the server is reloaded, CheckLicense will
   attempt to verify the machine license and detect that the license file
   is missing. This simulates the typical situation in a software package
   that includes the server components. The machine license would normally
   not be included in the package.

<li>From the LicCruiseCar menu, choose Create.
   The command will fail, because the machine license file is missing.
   This simulates an attempte to use components in an unlicensed copy of
   the server.

<li>From the UtilityCruiseCar menu, choose Create Using Key.
   This command will succeed in creating a COUtilityCruiseCar component,
   which internally creates a LicCruiseCar licensed component. Instead
   of calling CreateInstance, Create Using Key calls
   IClassFactory2::CreateInstanceLic, which uses the stored copy of
   the run-time license key. This simulates the normal run-time licensing
   behavior of the client in a package with a resold copy of the server.
</ol>

<P>
The client calls the CoGetClassObject COM API function to obtain an
IClassFactory2 interface on the class factory for LicCruiseCar components.
The factory is created, and the IClassFactory2::RequestLicKey method is
called. The license key is obtained, the interface is released, and the
CFLicCruiseCar class factory is destroyed normally.

<P>
We now perform step 3 and hide the machine license file, LICSERVE.LIC.
We then restart the LICSERVE server using the Lic Server command. Here
is the log of that sequence (step 4 above):

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">

  S: DllCanUnloadNow. cObjects=1, cLocks=0.

  C: Start LICSERVE Server Trace Logging.
  P: --- LICSERVE.DLL now logging to Client ---
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The ISample interface on the COLicCarSample object is released. Its
reference count goes to 0, and the object is destroyed. The server
decrements its object count to 0. When CoFreeUnusedLibraries is called
after this release, COM calls the server to see if it should be unloaded.
As the log shows, DllCanUnloadNow is called for each server. For the
LICSERVE server, the object count is 0, so COM unloads the server DLL. We
select this menu item again to re-engage LICSERVE server logging, which
reloads the server. At this point, LICSERVE detects that the license file
is missing.

<P>
We can confirm this by attempting to create a COLicCruiseCar component
using the Create command on the LicCruiseCar menu. Here's what the log
looks like with this attempt (step 5 above):

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  C: === LicCruiseCar Menu: Create.

  P: CFLicCruiseCar::Destructor.
  P: CFLicCruiseCar::CImpIClassFactory Destructor.
  C: ???? LicCruiseCar creation failed.
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Compare this with the trace log studied earlier for this same menu
selection. The call to CoCreateInstance causes COM to obtain an
IClassFactory interface on an appropriate class factory (CFLicCruiseCar)
in the LICSERVE server. The CreateInstance method is attempted as before.
But now we see the cascade of failure as the absence of a machine license
is discovered. When the call stack unwinds back to the client, an error
message is displayed.

<P>
For the final confirmation of run-time licensing, we perform step 6 and
choose the Create with Key command from the UtilityCruiseCar menu. Here
is the trace log, with some blank lines indicating sections for comment:

<P>
LICCLIEN calls the CreateUtilityCruiseCar function. This function creates
a new COUtilityCruiseCar COM object and calls the object's Init method to
create any inner objects. In this case, the important one is the licensed
COLicCruiseCar object that will be aggregated as part of the
COUtilityCruiseCar object. As before, the class factory is obtained. In
this case, however, the IClassFactory2 interface is explicitly requested,
because to create an instance of COLicCruiseCar with a run-time license,
the IClassFactory2::CreateInstanceLic method must be called.

<P>
This method is called by the client, and the saved license key string is
passed as an argument. The resultant creation of a new COLicCruiseCar
succeeds because the license key string is a match. If it was not, we
would see a cascade of failure, and the object would not be created.

<P>
As part of this COLicCruiseCar object, an inner COCar object must be
created and aggregated. The COLicCruiseCar::Init method gets the class
factory (CFCar in server DLLSERVE) and creates a COCar COM object. This
sequence is the same as in other creations of COLicCruiseCar components.

<P>
The COLicCruiseCar is created, and the class factory is released. LICSERVE
ends up with an object count of 2, one for the new COLicCruiseCar object
and one for the LicCarSample utility component. Control returns to the
client, where the trace log shows the final success of the
CreateUtilityCruiseCar function.
