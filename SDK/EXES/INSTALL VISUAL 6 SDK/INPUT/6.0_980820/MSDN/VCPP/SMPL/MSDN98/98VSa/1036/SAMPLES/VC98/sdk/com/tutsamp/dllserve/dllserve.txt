DLLSERVE - COM Server in a DLL


SUMMARY
=======

The COMOBJ sample introduced COM objects. This DLLSERVE sample introduces
COM components (also called simply component objects). A component object
is a reusable software unit that encapsulates or packages the
manufacturing of a specific class of COM object. A COM object class
specifies an open-ended set of behaviorally identical COM objects that is
uniquely identified for all programs and all time (by a Class ID).

Component objects are housed in a COM Server. The server executable is
registered (or published) in a system registry to act as the creation
agent for COM object instances of the COM Component. The server contains
one or more Class Factories used for the creation of COM objects. Class
factories are themselves COM objects that expose the IClassfactory[2]
interface.  However, as an integral part of the server housing, class
factories are typically not full-fledged component objects.

Component objects are the building blocks in COM and ActiveX programming.
Component objects are combined to make some portion of an application. The
running behavior of the applicaion is often determined by, and evidenced
in, the COM objects that were instantiated (i.e., that were manufactured
in the class factories of the various component objects that were combined
in the application).

The DLLSERVE sample begins with the car-related COM Objects of the
previous COMOBJ lesson and refashions them into components. To do so
requires little change to the COM objects themselves (COCar, COUtilityCar,
and COCruiseCar). But to envelop them as components, this lesson
introduces new facilities to house them in an in-process DLL COM server.
These facilities include class factories for each component and a
CarSample utility component that allows clients to see logged behavior in
the server itself.

The DLL server provides the following components: Car, UtilityCar,
CruiseCar, and CarSample.

In the series of COM tutorial code samples, DLLSERVE works with the
DLLCLIEN code sample to illustrate DLLSERVE's COM server facilities for
creating components that can be used by an EXE client and the subsequent
manipulation of those components by DLLCLIEN.EXE.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of DLLSERVE, see the
Code Tour section in DLLSERVE.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of DLLSERVE, see the Usage section in DLLSERVE.HTM. To
read DLLSERVE.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the DLLSERVE lesson in the table of lessons. You can also achieve
the same thing by clicking the DLLSERVE.HTM file after locating the main
tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also DLLCLIEN.HTM in the
main tutorial directory for more details on the DLLCLIEN client
application and how it works with DLLSERVE.DLL.

You must build DLLSERVE.DLL before building or running DLLCLIEN.
DLLSERVE's makefile automatically registers DLLSERVE's components in the
registry. These components must be registered before DLLSERVE is available
to outside COM clients as a server for those components. This registration
is done using the REGISTER.EXE utility built in the previous REGISTER
lesson. To build or run DLLSERVE, you should build the REGISTER code
sample first.

For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

Usage
-----

DLLSERVE is a DLL that is meant to be used primarily as a COM server.
Though it can be implicitly loaded by linking to its associated .LIB file,
it is normally used after an explicit LoadLibrary call (usually from COM's
CoGetClassObject function). Servers like DLLSERVE are registered in the
registry. To use DLLSERVE in a COM client program, a client does not need
to include DLLSERVE.H or link to DLLSERVE.LIB. A COM client of DLLSERVE
obtains access solely through its components' CLSIDs and COM services. For
DLLSERVE, those CLSIDs are CLSID_DllCar, CLSID_DllUtilityCar,
CLSID_DllCruiseCar, and CLSID_DllCarSample. The DLLCLIEN lesson shows how
this is done.

The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the DLLSERVE directory:

  nmake register

You can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the DLLSERVE directory.

  ..\register\register.exe dllserve.dll

These registration commands require a prior build of the REGISTER sample
in this series, as well as a prior build of DLLSERVE.DLL.

In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Win32 Platform SDK and Visual C++
include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which can be used in a similar fashion to
register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.
