LICSERVE - Licensed DLL Server


SUMMARY
=======

The LICSERVE sample introduces licensed components. LICSERVE modifies the
COCruiseCar component of the DLLSERVE code sample and houses it as a
licensed LicCruiseCar component in the LICSERVE.DLL COM server. This
in-process server provides the components LicCruiseCar and LicCarSample.
LicCarSample is the utility component that allows clients access to this
server's logged behavior.

LICSERVE provides class factories for each of these components. The class
factory for the LicCruiseCar component implements IClassFactory2, instead
of the usual IClassFactory, to provide the licensing mechanism for this
component. The LicCarSample component is not licensed and thus implements
IClassFactory.

In the series of COM tutorial code samples, LICSERVE works with the
LICCLIEN code sample to illustrate LICSERVE's COM server facilities for
creating licensed components and supporting the subsequent manipulation of
those components by the LICCLIEN.EXE client.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of LICSERVE, see the
Code Tour section in LICSERVE.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of LICSERVE, see the Usage section in LICSERVE.HTM. To
read LICSERVE.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the LICSERVE lesson in the table of lessons. You can also achieve
the same thing by clicking the LICSERVE.HTM file after locating the main
tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also LICCLIEN.HTM in the
main tutorial directory for more details on the LICCLIEN client
application and how it works with LICSERVE.EXE itself. You must build
LICSERVE.DLL before building or running LICCLIEN. LICSERVE's makefile
automatically registers LICSERVE's components in the system registry.
These components must be registered before LICSERVE is available to
outside COM clients as a server for those components. This registration is
done using the REGISTER.EXE utility built in the earlier REGISTER lesson.
To build or run LICSERVE, you should build the REGISTER code sample first.

For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE
is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

Usage
-----

LICSERVE is a DLL that is meant to be used primarily as a licensed COM
server. Though it can be implicitly loaded by linking to its associated
.LIB file, it is normally used after an explicit LoadLibrary call, usually
from COM's CoGetClassObject function. Servers like LICSERVE are registered
in the registry. To use LICSERVE in a COM client program, a client does not
need to include LICSERVE.H or link to LICSERVE.LIB. A COM client of LICSERVE
obtains access solely through its components' CLSIDs and COM services. For
LICSERVE, those CLSIDs are CLSID_LicCruiseCar and CLSID_LicCarSample. The
LICCLIEN sample shows how this is done with the LicCruiseCar component that
is licensed in the LICSERVE server.

The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the LICSERVE directory:

  nmake register

You can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the LICSERVE directory.

  ..\register\register.exe licserve.dll

These registration commands require a prior build of the REGISTER sample
in this series, as well as a prior build of LICSERVE.DLL.

In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Win32 Platform SDK and Visual C++
include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which can be used in a similar fashion to
register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.
