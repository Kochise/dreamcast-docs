<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>The stream architecture allows applications to communicate with the filter graph manager; it also allows
 the filter graph manager to communicate with individual filters to control the movement of the 
data through the filter graph. Using the stream architecture, filters can post events that the application can retrieve, so an application can, for example, retrieve status information about a special filter it 
has installed.

<P>The filter graph manager exposes media control and media positioning interfaces to the 
application. The media control interface, <A HREF="dssd0149.htm#If_000106013d000000" TARGET="TEXT">IMediaControl</A>, allows the application to issue commands 
to run, pause, and stop the stream. The positioning interface, <A HREF="dssd0158.htm#If_0001060146000000" TARGET="TEXT">IMediaSeeking</A>, lets the application specify which section of the stream 
to play. 

<P>Individual filters expose an <A HREF="dssd0116.htm#If_000106011c000000" TARGET="TEXT">IBaseFilter</A> interface so that the filter graph manager can issue 
the run, pause, and stop control commands. The filter graph manager is responsible for calling 
these methods in the correct order on all the filters in the filter graph. (The application should 
not do this directly.)

<P>For position commands, the filter graph manager is called by the 
application to, for example, play a specified length of media stream starting at some specified stream 
time. However, unlike the <A HREF="dssd0116.htm#If_000106011c000000" TARGET="TEXT">IBaseFilter</A> interface, only the renderer filter exposes an <A HREF="dssd0158.htm#If_0001060146000000" TARGET="TEXT">IMediaSeeking</A> interface. Therefore, the filter graph manager calls only the renderer filter with positioning information. 
The renderer then passes this position control information upstream through <B>IMediaSeeking</B> interfaces
exposed on the pins, which simply pass it on. The positioning of the media stream is actually handled 
by the output pin on the filter that is able to seek to a particular position, usually a parser filter such as the AVI splitter.
<P>Position information is passed serially upstream because there might be filters between the 
renderer and the source filter that require position information. Consider 
a transform filter that is written to perform some video or audio modification only during the first 
10 seconds of a video clip (for example, increasing the volume or fading in the video). This filter 
probably needs to have information about where the stream is starting so that it can determine its 
correct behavior. For example, it should not perform if the start time is after the first 10 seconds, 
or it should adjust accordingly if the start time is within this duration.
<P>Filters also get position information from the <A HREF="dssd0165.htm#If_000106014d030900" TARGET="TEXT">IPin::NewSegment</A> method which provides the media start and stop times for the next set of samples and the rate to be associated with those samples.
