DCOMDRAW - Client of structured storage server


SUMMARY
=======

The DCOMDRAW, DCDSERVE, and DCDMARSH samples together form a distributed
drawing application. Using Distributed COM (DCOM) technology, they allow
users on different client machines in a network to interactively draw on a
shared drawing. All DCOMDRAW clients see the same drawing and any client
can take ownership of the pen to draw. The user of DCOMDRAW can use a
mouse or tablet device to draw in the client window and can choose the
color and width of the electronic ink. As clients draw, the application
echoes the drawing activity from DCDSERVE to all connected clients using
DCOM over the network. Although these samples do not build an optimized
and complete application, the functionality is suggestive of the shared
whiteboards offered by some workgroup applications.

Although DCOMDRAW, DCDSERVE, and DCDMARSH work on the same machine across
process boundaries, the main goal is to provide a distributed application
that enables multiple DCOMDRAW clients on different machines to access a
single shared drawing object housed in a DCDSERVE server running on a
common server machine. A typical scenario would have numerous client
machines hooked to an intranet consisting of a Windows NT network domain
or peer-to-peer workgroup. DCOMDRAW can run on any of these client
machines. DCDSERVE is installed and runs on a common server machine in the
domain. The user of the DCOMDRAW client can interactively choose the
remote server machine to determine which DCDSERVE COM server to use for
the shared drawing.

DCDSERVE manages a shared, single COPaper COM object that models a sheet
of white drawing paper. Clients can use the methods of the COPaper object
to draw on the paper surface using "ink" of specified color and
width. This functionality is outwardly similar to the "scribble"
tutorial samples in many versions of the Microsoft Visual C++&reg;
product. The drawing paper features of COPaper objects are exposed to
DCOMDRAW clients by a custom ISharePaper interface. COPaper implements the
ISharePaper interface. A clear architectural distinction is kept between
client and server. No graphical user interface (GUI) is provided by the
COPaper object. It relies on the DCOMDRAW client for all GUI behavior.
COPaper encapsulates only the server-based capture and storage of the
drawn ink data.

The ink data that is drawn on the COPaper surface can be stored in and
loaded from compound files. The ISharePaper::Save and ISharePaper::Load
method implementations in COPaper use structured storage to store the
current data of the shared drawing in a compound file kept with
DCDSERVE.EXE on the machine acting as the common server.

The DCOMDRAW sample creates and uses the connectable COPaper COM object
that is provided as the CLSID_SharePaper component in the DCDSERVE server.
The DCOMDRAW client creates a COPaper object and controls it using the
methods of the ISharePaper interface. DCOMDRAW obtains drawing data from
the user and displays that data in a window that it manages. DCOMDRAW uses
COPaper's ISharePaper interface to save the drawing data in COPaper and to
direct file-storage operations on this data.

COPaper only manages the drawing data; it performs no GUI actions.
DCOMDRAW provides the GUI for the drawing application by encapsulating
this functionality in a central CGuiPaper C++ object.

DCOMDRAW also implements the custom IPaperSink interface on a COPaperSink
COM object and connects this interface to an appropriate connection point
on the COPaper object in DCDSERVE. COPaper uses the connected IPaperSink
interface to send notifications back to the COPaperSink in DCOMDRAW. The
normal GUI repainting of COPaper's drawing data is done in DCOMDRAW using
COPaper's connectable object technology. Thus in this sample, COM's
connectable-object technology uses DCOM to function transparently across
the network. In earlier samples such as STOCLIEN and STOSERVE, COM's
connectable-object technology was shown operating only in-process.

The two ISharePaper and IPaperSink custom interfaces are declared in
PAPINT.H, which is located in the common INC directory. PAPINT.H is
automatically generated in the DCDMARSH sample. The GUIDs for the
interfaces and objects are defined in PAPGUIDS.H located in that same
directory.

This lesson focuses primarily on how to take care of DCOM process security
on the client side and how to load a remote object using DCOM. Using
CoInitializeSecurity to set process security is covered.
CoCreateInstanceEx using the MULTI_QI structure is covered.

Because client and server run in separate processes--usually on different
computers--both DCDSERVE and DCOMDRAW rely on standard marshaling for the
ISharePaper and IPaperSink custom interfaces. The DCDMARSH sample provides
this support, so you must build (or otherwise register) DCDMARSH.DLL on
both machines prior to building and running DCDSERVE and DCOMDRAW across
machines.

To set a DCOMDRAW client on one machine to control the common DCDSERVE
server on another, both machines must have DCOM (Distributed COM)
installed. DCOM is included in Windows NT 4.0 or above and in Windows 98.
If a computer is running Windows 95, you must install the DCOM95 add on.
DCOM95 can currently be obtained by download from Microsoft's world wide
Web site at: http://www.microsoft.com/com/.

The multiple computers must be connected in a properly configured network.
For details on setting up a network, see your Windows NT product
documentation or the Windows NT Resource Kit. For more details on computer
and network setup for running with DCOM, see the "Network and Setup
Issues" section at the end of the REMCLIEN lesson. Note that the less
restrictive security in Windows 95 and Windows 98 prevents the SCM under
DCOM from automatically launching DCDSERVE on behalf of a remote DCOMDRAW
client. You must manually pre-launch DCDSERVE on these operating systems
if you attempt a remote load of DCDSERVE from a DCOMDRAW running on
another machine. The DCDSERVE and DCOMDRAW lessons assume that you install
DCDSERVE on a machine running Windows NT Server or Workstation.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of DCOMDRAW, see the
Code Tour section in DCOMDRAW.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of DCOMDRAW, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
DCOMDRAW.HTM. To read DCOMDRAW.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the DCOMDRAW lesson in the table of lessons. You can
do the same thing by locating the main tutorial directory in the Windows
Explorer and double-clicking the DCOMDRAW.HTM file. For more details on
how DCDSERVE works and exposes its services to DCOMDRAW, see DCDSERVE.HTM
in the main tutorial directory. The makefile for DCDSERVE automatically
registers that server in the registry of the host machine, so you must
build DCDSERVE on the remote machine before attempting to run DCOMDRAW.

For general details on setting up your system to build and test Win32 code
samples such as those in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM.
The supplied MAKEFILE is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug
build, issue the NMAKE command in the command-prompt window.


Usage
-----

DCOMDRAW is an application that you can execute directly from Windows or
from the command-prompt window. No command-line parameters are recognized
by DCOMDRAW. DCOMDRAW currently runs on the Windows 95 operating system
with the DCOM95 update for Windows 95 installed. It will run on Windows 98
which includes DCOM. It will also run under version 4 or later of Windows
NT Workstation or Windows NT Server.
