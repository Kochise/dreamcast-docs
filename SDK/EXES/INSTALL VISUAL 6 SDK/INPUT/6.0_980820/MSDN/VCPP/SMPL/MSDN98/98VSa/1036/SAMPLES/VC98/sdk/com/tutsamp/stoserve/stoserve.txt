STOSERVE - Structured Storage in an in-process server


SUMMARY
=======

The STOSERVE sample introduces the COPaper COM object, which models a
sheet of white drawing paper. COPaper objects expose a set of features for
free-form drawing on the paper surface using "ink" of specified color and
width. The functionality is outwardly similar to other "scribble" C++
tutorial samples. The difference in the STOSERVE/STOCLIEN samples is an
architecture based primarily on COM technology. The electronic drawing
paper features of COPaper objects are available to clients through a
custom IPaper interface. COPaper implements the IPaper interface. A clear
architectural distinction is kept between client and server. No graphical
user interface (GUI) is provided by COPaper. The design of the COPaper
object relies on the client for all GUI behavior. COPaper encapsulates
only the server-based capture and storage of the drawn ink data.

The ink data that is drawn on the COPaper surface can be stored in and
loaded from COM compound files. The IPaper Save and Load methods accept an
IStorage interface pointer. COPaper uses this client-provided IStorage
interface to store the drawing data.

The primary focus of this code sample is on the use of COM structured
storage services as provided in the COM compound files implementation. The
use of the standard IStorage and IStream interfaces is covered. STOSERVE
works with the STOCLIEN code sample to illustrate the joint use of
compound file storage by client and server.

COPaper is housed in an in-process server and is made publicly available
as a custom COM component. Like all other servers in this tutorial series,
STOSERVE is a self-registering COM server. It makes the COPaper object
type available to clients as the DllPaper component using a
CLSID_DllPaper registration in the Registry.

As was the case in the previous CONSERVE server, connectable object
features are supported in COPaper. The IConnectionPointContainer interface
is exposed, and an appropriate connection point is implemented. In this
context, an outgoing custom IPaperSink interface is declared for use in
sending notifications to the client.

The two IPaper and IPaperSink custom interfaces are declared in IPAPER.H
located in the common sibling \INC directory. The GUIDs for the interfaces
and objects are defined in PAPGUIDS.H located in that same common include
directory.

The CThreaded facility in APPUTIL is used by STOSERVE to achieve thread
safety, as it was in the FRESERVE sample. COPaper objects are derived from
the CThreaded class and inherit its OwnThis and UnOwnThis methods. These
methods allow only one thread at a time to have access to the STOSERVE
server and to COPaper objects managed by the server.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of STOSERVE, see the
Code Tour section in STOSERVE.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of STOSERVE, see the Usage section in STOSERVE.HTM. To
read STOSERVE.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the STOSERVE lesson in the table of lessons. You can also achieve
the same thing by clicking the STOSERVE.HTM file after locating the main
tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also STOCLIEN.HTM in the
main tutorial directory for more details on the STOCLIEN client
application and how it works with STOSERVE.DLL. You must build
STOSERVE.DLL before building or running STOCLIEN.

STOSERVE's makefile automatically registers STOSERVE's DllPaper COM
component in the registry. This component must be registered before
STOSERVE is available to outside COM clients as a server for that
component. This self-registration is done using the REGISTER.EXE utility
built in the REGISTER sample. To build or run STOSERVE, you should build
the REGISTER code sample first.

For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

Usage
-----

To use STOSERVE, a client program does not need to include STOSERVE.H or
link to STOSERVE.LIB. A COM client of STOSERVE obtains access solely
through its object's CLSID and COM services. For STOSERVE, that CLSID is
CLSID_DllPaper (defined in file PAPGUIDS.H in the \INC sibling directory).
The STOCLIEN code sample shows how the client obtains this access.

STOSERVE is a DLL that is intended primarily as a COM server. Although it
can be implicitly loaded by linking to its associated .LIB file, it is
normally used after an explicit LoadLibrary call, usually from within the
COM function CoGetClassObject. STOSERVE is a self-registering in-process
server.

The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the STOSERVE directory:

  nmake register

You can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the STOSERVE directory.

  ..\register\register.exe stoserve.dll

These registration commands require a prior build of the REGISTER sample
in this series, as well as a prior build of STOSERVE.DLL.

In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Win32 Platform SDK and Visual C++
include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which can be used in a similar fashion to
register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.
