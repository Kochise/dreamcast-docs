<h2><a name="APTSERVE">APTSERVE - Local Server with Multiple Apartments</a></h2>

<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
The apartment model is a way of COM programming that associates a single
thread of execution with a family of COM objects in such a way that an
object in the family will be executed only on the thread of its apartment.
When this arrangement is constructed in a server, COM plays a role in
enforcing the single-thread rule for objects in the apartment by ensuring
that client calls on any thread to objects in a server apartment will only
be executed on the thread of the apartment.

<P>
The APTSERVE sample begins with the car-related COM Objects of the
previous LOCSERVE sample and rehouses them in an out-of-process local
server, APTSERVE.EXE, that uses the apartment threading model. To do so
requires little change to the COM objects themselves (COCar, COUtilityCar,
and COCruiseCar). The COCruiseCar object required some changes. In
LOCSERVE COCruiseCar reused the COCar object using aggregation. Since this
sample rehouses these objects within different apartments, COCruiseCar
must be recoded to reuse COCar using containment. But most importantly,
the server housing must undergo significant revision. This sample
introduces the new facilities to partition each class factory and its
created object instances into a separate apartment.

<P>
In this sample, an out-of-process COM server is partitioned into three
single-threaded apartments, each corresponding to the component types seen
in previous samples: AptCar, AptUtilityCar, and AptCruiseCar. These
components are known by their CLSIDs as: CLSID_AptCar,
CLSID_AptUtilityCar, and CLSID_AptCruiseCar. Appropriate class factories
for those components are also provided: CFCar, CFUtilityCar, and
CFCruiseCar. As compared to the implementation of these class factories in
previous lessons, no significant change to the class factories themselves
is required in this sample.

<P>
In the series of COM tutorial code samples, APTSERVE works with the
APTCLIEN code sample to illustrate APTSERVE's partitioning of the server
facilities for creating and manipulating components within separate
apartments and to show how the components are accessed by a client.

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of APTSERVE, see the
Code Tour section in APTSERVE.HTM. For details on the programmatic usage
of APTSERVE, see the Usage section in APTSERVE.HTM. To read APTSERVE.HTM,
run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and click the APTSERVE
lesson in the table of lessons. You can also achieve the same thing by
clicking the APTSERVE.HTM file after locating the main tutorial directory
in the Windows Explorer. See also APTCLIEN.HTM in the main tutorial
directory for more details on the APTCLIEN client application and how it
works with APTSERVE.EXE.

<P>
You must build APTSERVE.EXE before building or running APTCLIEN. The
accompanying makefile automatically registers APTSERVE components in the
registry. These components must be registered before APTSERVE is available
to outside COM clients as a server for those components. This registration
is done using the REGISTER.EXE utility built in the earlier REGISTER
lesson. To build or run APTSERVE, you should build the REGISTER code
sample first.

<P>
Like its predecessors, APTSERVE uses many of the utility classes and
services provided by APPUTIL. For more details on APPUTIL, study the
APPUTIL library's source code and APPUTIL.HTM, located in the main
tutorial directory.

<P>
As an out-of-process local server with several single-threaded apartments,
APTSERVE relies on standard marshaling for clients to use its interfaces
across both thread and process boundaries. Such marshaling is provided in
the MARSHAL.DLL server built in the previous lesson. To build or run
APTSERVE, you should build the MARSHAL code sample first.

<P>
For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE
is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

<P>
Like the LOCSERVE/LOCCLIEN pair, APTSERVE uses APPUTIL's CSendLog trace
logging facility to allow display of internal APTSERVE behavior integrated
with client behavior in the APTCLIEN log display. See APTCLIEN.HTM for
more details setting up this logging operation. See LOCSERVE.HTM for
details on how CSendLog works.

<h4>Usage</h4>

<P>
The APTSERVE application is meant to be used as an out-of-process COM
server. Out-of-process servers like APTSERVE are registered in the system
registry, and APTSERVE has built-in support for registering its
components. It accepts the following command line switches to register and
unregister:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  -RegServer or /RegServer to register
  -UnregServer or /UnregServer to unregister
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
String matches on these switches are case-insensitive. APTSERVE also
recognizes the standard -Embedding or /Embedding switch, which directs it
to run as an out-of-process server. This switch normally means that the
server will remain hidden when run by COM on behalf of a client. As an
out-of-process server, APTSERVE is not designed to run visable as a
stand-alone application. If you attempt to run APTSERVE as a stand-alone
application with no command line switches, it will exit with an error.

<P>
The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the APTSERVE directory:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  nmake register
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This assumes that you have a compilation environment set up. If not, you
can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the APTSERVE directory.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  ..\register\register.exe aptserve.exe
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
These registration commands require a prior build of the REGISTER sample
in this series, as well as a prior build of APTSERVE.EXE.

<h4>Run the Sample</h4>

<p>
The client sample and other related samples must be compiled before
you can run the client. For more details on building the samples, see
<a href="using.htm#building">
Building the Code Samples.</a>

<P>
If you have already built the appropriate samples, APTCLIEN.EXE is the
client executable to run for this sample.

<a href="APTCLIEN\APTCLIEN.exe">
Click here to run APTCLIEN.EXE.</a>

<P>
Depending on the security level of your browser you may see a dialog
allowing you to either open the .EXE file or save it to disk. Click the
"Open it" choice and then click the OK button.

<P>
With the APTSERVE code sample, we introduce several single-threaded
apartments in a COM server. In keeping with the graduated tutorial
sequence in these code samples, APTSERVE retains the COCar, COUtilityCar,
and COCruiseCar components and modifies their server housing and class
factories to house, create, and manage those components in separate
apartments.

<P>
The LOCSERVE out-of-process local server code sample is the starting
point.  LOCSERVE is a single-thread server: The main process thread is the
only thread that directly manipulates the server's class factories and COM
objects. This single thread can be viewed as the one and only single
thread apartment (STA) of LOCSERVE.

<P>
COM supports multiple threading in both client and server applications.
For a server application with multiple apartments, some housekeeping is
required to partition the application's threads and to inform COM of the
arrangement. In APTSERVE, there is a separate STA apartment thread for
each class factory. COM objects reside on the same apartment thread as the
class factory that creates them. Each class factory and all of its object
instances reside in the same single-threaded apartment. There is an
arrangement of three such single-threaded apartments in this sample but it
is certainly not the only possible arrangement of multiple apartments and
class factories in a server.

<P>
Under the apartment model, there can be multiple COM objects on a thread,
but calls to an object must execute on the thread that &quot;owns&quot;
the object. This thread is called the object's apartment thread and
interface requests to the object from another thread must be marshaled to
the apartment thread that owns the object, just as if the object were in
another process.

<P>
In these code samples, interface calls across process boundaries are
marshaled to convert the call from the context of the calling process to
the context of the owning server process. We studied this in the LOCSERVE
and LOCCLIEN lessons, where the necessary marshaling was provided by the
MARSHAL.DLL standard marshaling server (created in the MARSHAL sample).
When the change in the call context is from one apartment to another, this
same standard marshaling is used. This marshaling is required even if the
threads reside within the same process, as in this APTSERVE sample.

<P>The following coding rules apply to apartment-threaded servers:

<ol>
<li>
Every object is owned by only one apartment thread and calls to the object
must execute on that thread.

<li>
Each apartment thread must call OleInitialize or CoInitialize during
thread initialization to initialize COM for each apartment.

<li>
To ensure that all requests to an object are made on its apartment thread,
all pointers to objects must be marshaled between apartments.

<li>
Each apartment with COM objects in it must have a message queue to handle
calls from other apartments in the same process or from other processes.

<li>
Apartment-aware objects in in-process servers must be registered as being
apartment-aware in the system registry.

<li>
Apartment-aware objects in in-process servers must write DLL entry points
carefully.

</ol>

<P>
APTSERVE has three single-threaded apartments, one for each class of
component housed in the server. The CFCar class factory and all COCar COM
objects are managed in one apartment. The CFUtilityCar class factory and
all COUtilityCar COM objects are managed in a separate apartment, as are
the CFCruiseCar class factory and all COCruiseCar COM objects.

<P>
Since each class factory and its instantiated objects reside in a separate
apartment, client access through their interfaces must be marshaled. This
is so even if both apartment threads reside in the same process. In this
lesson, some of the composite objects that are created and managed in one
apartment of APTSERVE are constructed by reusing objects created and
managed in another apartment. For example, the COCruiseCar object of the
AptCruiseCar apartment reuses a COCar object of the AptCar apartment.

<P>
Almost all the coding changes needed to partition APTSERVE into three
apartments are found in the server housing, which is programmed in files
SERVER.H and SERVER.CPP.

<P>
Single-threaded apartments are implemented as separate program threads,
each of which has its own message loop for processing messages sent to the
thread. Each also has a main thread procedure. When creating the thread
using the _beginthreadex or CreateThread functions, we pass a pointer to
an apartment thread procedure. We also pass a pointer to a thread's
initialization data. As the operating system then creates the thread, it
calls the thread procedure passing the initialization data pointer, as an
LPARAM. We will look at these mechanisms in the source code

<P>
First there are some CServer member variables needed to identify the three
apartments.  Here are some appropriate declarations from SERVER.H.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  // Apartment Thread Initialization data.
  enum { NUM_APARTMENTS = 3 };
  enum { APTCAR = 0, APTUTILITYCAR = 1, APTCRUISECAR = 2 };
  struct APT_INIT_DATA
  {
    REFCLSID rclsid;
    IUnknown* pcf;

    // Member initializer MUST be used here because VC++ 4.0+ is strict
    // about const and reference (&amp;) types like REFCLSID that need to
    // be initialized in this app.  For example, VC++ 4.x will not permit
    // a simple assignment of rclsid in the constructor.
    APT_INIT_DATA(REFCLSID rclsidi) : rclsid(rclsidi)
    {
      pcf = NULL;
    };

    ~APT_INIT_DATA() {};
  };

  };
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Compared to the previous LOCSERVE sample, we see that the Server control
object for APTSERVE has member variable storage for pointers to each
apartment's thread init data, thread IDs used later to send messages to
the threads, and methods to ensure mutually exclusive access to shared
data in this multithreaded server.

<P>
It is important to ensure that all threads within the server, as well as
those in all outside clients, have controlled access to shared server
data. In previous samples in this series, the Win32 functions
InterlockedIncrement and InterlockedDecrement were used to ensure mutually
exclusive access to the server's object and lock counts among multiple
client processes. With this sample, a more general mechanism is used to
serialize access to server data shared by apartment threads. This
mechanism uses the Win32 Mutex facility. CServer is derived from a base
class declared in APPUTIL.H, CThreaded, which provides such a mechanism.
Any C++ class can be derived from CThreaded to provide mutually exclusive
access by asynchronous multiple threads. See APPUTIL.H for more details on
the CThreaded class. We will cover its use here in CServer.

<P>
The mutex is created in the CThreaded constructor. Here is the CThreaded
class declaration from APPUTIL.H.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  class CThreaded
  {
    protected:
      // Variables for providing mutually exclusive access by multiple
      // threads to objects of classes derived from this class.
      HANDLE    m_hOwnerMutex;
      BOOL      m_bOwned;

    public:
      // Methods.
      CThreaded(void) :
        m_hOwnerMutex(CreateMutex(0,FALSE,0)),
        m_bOwned(FALSE)
      {
      };

      ~CThreaded(void)
      {
        // Close down the mutex.
        CloseHandle(m_hOwnerMutex);
      };

      // These virtual functions have overriding definitions in the
      // derived class to provide convenient trace logging. Rely on
      // the below default definitions for non-tutorial applications.

      virtual BOOL OwnThis(void)
      {
        BOOL bOwned = FALSE;

        if (WAIT_OBJECT_0 == WaitForSingleObject(m_hOwnerMutex, INFINITE))
          m_bOwned = bOwned = TRUE;

        return bOwned;
      };

      virtual void UnOwnThis(void)
      {
        if (m_bOwned)
        {
          m_bOwned = FALSE;
          ReleaseMutex(m_hOwnerMutex);
        }

        return;
      };
  };
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
CServer inherits the protected m_hOwnerMutex and m_bOwned data members
from CThreaded. CServer also provides overriding definitions for the
CThreaded virtual functions OwnThis and UnOwnThis. In a normal application
we could rely on the default definitions provided in CThreaded for these
methods. In this tutorial code sample, however, we provide definitions of
OwnThis and UnOwnThis that offer convenient trace logging of their
behavior.

<P>
The m_hOwnerMutex is created solely to govern access to the CServer C++
object. A Boolean flag is initialized to FALSE and is used to indicate
when a requesting thread has been permitted to &quot;own&quot; the CServer
object. The owning thread has exclusive access to the object. Member
initializers in CThreaded are used to initialize m_hOwnerMutex and
m_bOwned. The mutex is closed during the CThreaded destructor.

<P>
Once created, the mutex m_hOwnerMutex can be used in other methods of
CServer that may be called by multiple threads to access its shared data.
The most important shared data in this case is the CServe member data
variables m_cObjects and m_cLocks. Here is a representative method (in
SERVER.CPP).

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  void CServer::ObjectsDown(void)
  {
    if (OwnThis())
    {
      if (m_cObjects &gt; 0)
        m_cObjects -= 1;

      LOGF2(&quot;L&lt;%X&gt;: CServer::ObjectsDown. New cObjects=%i.&quot;,TID,m_cObjects);

      // If no more living objects and no locks then shut down the server.
      if (0L == m_cObjects &amp;&amp; 0L == m_cLocks &amp;&amp; IsWindow(m_hWndServer))
      {
        LOGF1(&quot;L&lt;%X&gt;: CServer::ObjectsDown. Closing down APTSERVE server.&quot;,TID);

        // Relinquish current thread ownership of CServer before signaling
        // the main server thread to close down the entire server. During
        // shutdown other threads may need to access CServer.
        UnOwnThis();

        // Post a message to this local server's message queue requesting
        // a close of the entire server application. This will force a
        // termination of all apartment threads (including the one that
        // may be executing this ObjectsDown)
        PostMessage(m_hWndServer, WM_CLOSE, 0, 0L);
      }
      else
        UnOwnThis();
    }

    return;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Two shared data members, m_cObjects and m_cLocks, are either changed or
accessed by this ObjectsDown method. The mutual exclusion mechanism uses
the bracketed pairs of calls to the OwnThis and UnOwnThis methods. Inside
the bracketed pair, the mechanism guarantees that no other threads will
access or change the shared data. Thus a call to the above ObjectsDown
method will block a thread in the OwnThis call until any current owner
thread completes its access to CServer and relinquishes its ownership by
calling the UnOwnThis method. When there are no longer any existing
objects or locks on the server, ownership of CServer by the executing
thread is relinquished before a PostMessage call signals the entire server
to shut down. This is done above because other threads may need to access
CServer during shutdown. When honoring the posted WM_CLOSE, the main
server thread terminates the apartment threads. Depending on thread
scheduling, ownership of CServer could be held by a thread that was
terminated during shutdown. This could block any other threads from ever
accessing CServer.

<P>
The OwnThis method returns TRUE when the executing thread is permitted
access. Here is the overriding OwnThis definition from SERVER.CPP.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  BOOL CServer::OwnThis(void)
  {
    BOOL bOwned = FALSE;

    LOGF1(&quot;L: CServer::OwnThis. Thread &lt;%X&gt; waiting to own CServer.&quot;,TID);

    if (WAIT_OBJECT_0 == WaitForSingleObject(m_hOwnerMutex, INFINITE))
    {
      m_bOwned = TRUE;
      LOGF1(&quot;L: CServer::OwnThis. CServer now owned by Thread &lt;%X&gt;.&quot;,TID);
    }

    return bOwned;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The Win32 function WaitForSingleObject waits for the mutex to signal that
the mutex is not owned by any thread. This call requests ownership of the
mutex for the calling thread, changing the mutex's state to nonsignaled
when ownership is granted. Until such access is permitted, some other
thread has ownership of CServer, and the current thread must wait. Such a
waiting thread is said to be &quot;blocked&quote;. During this time, the
current owning thread is executing code in its own bracketed
OwnThis-UnOwnThis pair. When the current owning thread completes its
access, it calls UnOwnThis to relinquish ownership. Here is UnOwnThis from
file SERVER.CPP.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  void CServer::UnOwnThis(void)
  {
    if (m_bOwned)
    {
      LOGF1(&quot;L: CServer::UnOwnThis. Ownership relinquished by &lt;%X&gt;.&quot;,TID);
      m_bOwned = FALSE;
      ReleaseMutex(m_hOwnerMutex);
    }

    return;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Because three different apartment threads run in the APTSERVE server, the
same CServer is shared between them. As a result, the CServer methods
which access its shared data must all honor this ownership protocol by
properly calling the OwnThis and UnOwnThis methods as shown above for
ObjectsDown. Thus the Lock, Unlock, ObjectsUp, ObjectsDown, OpenFactories,
and CloseFactories methods are all coded using the OwnThis and UnOwnThis
pairs.

<P>
When the first client requests creation of a component in APTSERVE, COM
loads and runs this EXE local server. Like LOCSERVE, when APTSERVE runs,
it creates and registers its class factories. When clients make any
subsequent creation requests of APTSERVE, COM uses the already running
server and its registered class factories. Thus, one running instance of
the class factories is shared by all the clients. Because these shared
class factories are registered within separate apartment threads, COM's
support of the apartment model ensures that calls to interfaces in objects
created by these class factories will be called on the same thread that
originally called on the class factory to create the object. The first
point of recognition by COM in this regard is the occasion of the object's
first marshaled interface. This is often the IClassFactory interface
pointer requested in the CoGetClassObject call.

<P>
In APTSERVE the server provides an OpenFactories method, as did the
LOCSERVE server. The OpenFactories code used in LOCSERVE requires
significant changes to work in APTSERVE. Here is OpenFactories from
SERVER.CPP.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  BOOL CServer::OpenFactories(void)

<P>
The class factory objects (CFCar, CFUtilityCar, and CFCruiseCar) are
created as before in LOCSERVE. However, we now assign an apartment
initialization structure and create a separate thread of execution for
each class factory. We will see how this factory is registered with COM on
this apartment thread. Notice the use of member initializers for the new
APT_INIT_DATA structures. As seen earlier in the declaration of the
APT_INIT_DATA structure, the REFCLSID member cannot be initialized in the
constructor or assigned later, because the COM/OLE header files declare
REFCLSIDs as const references. The newer C++ compilers are strict about
this and force the use of member initializers for assigning REFCLSID
member variables.

<P>
A StartThread function is used to simplify the use of the C Runtime
library's _beginthreadex function. StartThread is defined locally in the
APTSERVE module. The _beginthreadex function is used in this sample. It
has some advantages over the Win32 CreateThread function. When it is
anticipated that the new thread will make calls to C Runtime functions,
then the _begintheadex call performs some necessary C Runtime setup and
memory management which the Win32 CreateThread function does not.

<P>
When the StartThread function is called, a pointer to a thread procedure
is passed (AptThreadProc above). The operating system will call this
thread procedure when it creates the thread. When it does so, it passes
the pointer to the APT_INIT_DATA structure as an LPARAM. The same
AptThreadProc is re-intrant and can be used by all of the single threaded
apartments. Here is the AptThreadProc from SERVER.CPP.

<P>
The call to CoInitialize in the new thread initializes COM for use by that
thread under the apartment model. The single-threaded apartment model is
requested implicitly in this call because it is the default. The above
CoInitialize call is equivalent to:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED);
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The newly created class factory is then registered with COM in the context
of the new thread that is executing. The thread then enters a message loop
in this common apartment procedure. The loop will not be exited until the
thread receives a WM_QUIT message. We will see such a message sent below
in the CloseFactories method. When the loop exits, the registered class
factory is revoked with COM. Then a CoUninitialize call is made to
complete the shutdown of the apartment.

<P>Here is the CloseFactories method from SERVER.CPP.

<P>
CloseFactories is called in the server application's CMainWindow
destructor. The shutdown sequence is initiated by the server itself on the
basis of the object and lock counts. For example, see the earlier listing
of the ObjectsDown method of CServer. ObjectsDown detects when there are
no longer any existing COM objects or lock counts. If so, it issues the
following call causing an eventual execution of CMainWindow's destructor.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  PostMessage(m_hWndServer, WM_CLOSE, 0, 0L);
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
When the application's main window is closed in response to the WM_CLOSE
message, the main window procedure is called with the WM_DESTROY message.
This message is sent when the window is being destroyed in response to a
close of the window. Because CMainWindow is derived from APPUTIL's
CVirWindow, WM_DESTROY is trapped by CVirWindow's WindowProc function
where a delete of CMainWindow is performed. This runs the CMainWindow
destructor which calls the CloseFactories method. CloseFactories posts
WM_QUIT messages to the individual apartment threads. The
WaitForMultipleObjects function is called above in CloseFactories to wait
for the posted WM_QUIT messages to reach their intended threads and cause
those threads to terminate. When all the apartment threads have signaled
their termination, all the thread handles are closed in a for loop. The
CMainWindow destructor finally issues a WM_QUIT message to the
application's main thread and causes the exit of its message loop and a
resultant exit of the entire server application.

<P>
In order to properly build this multithreaded application, the makefile
used in the LOCSERVE sample needed some changes. The C++ compilation
switches were changed to command the C++ compiler to compile a
multithreaded program. Here is an example of the compile command line of
the SERVER.CPP file, showing the use of the cvarsmt macro defined in
WIN32.MAK file of the Platform SDK.  Other single threaded EXE
applications required only the use of the cvars macro.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">

  $(cc) $(cvarsmt) $(cflags) $(CDBG) -Fo$@ server.cpp
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
The link flags were changed to support the use of the olelibsmt macro
defined in WIN32.MAK. Here is the LINKFLAGS macro.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  # If UNICODE=1 is defined then define UNICODE during Compiles.
  # The default is to compile with ANSI for running under both
  # Win95 and WinNT.
  !IFDEF UNICODE
  LINKFLAGS = $(ldebug) /NOD:libc.lib /NOD:msvcrt.lib /NOD:libcd.lib \
    /NOD:libcmtd.lib /NOD:msvcrtd.lib
  CDBG=$(cdebug) -DUNICODE -D_UNICODE
  RCFLAGS = -DWIN32 -DRC_INCLUDE -DUNICODE
  !ELSE
  LINKFLAGS = $(ldebug) /NOD:libc.lib /NOD:msvcrt.lib /NOD:libcd.lib \
    /NOD:libcmtd.lib /NOD:msvcrtd.lib
  CDBG=$(cdebug)
  RCFLAGS = -DWIN32 -DRC_INCLUDE
  !ENDIF
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
The /NOD (no default) switches to the linker permit the use of the
olelibsmt in the final link command. Here it is.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
