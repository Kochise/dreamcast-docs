DCDSERVE - DCOM Server Using Security


SUMMARY
=======

The DCOMDRAW, DCDSERVE, and DCDMARSH samples together form a distributed
drawing application. Using Distributed COM (DCOM) technology, they allow
users on different client machines in a network to interactively draw on a
shared drawing. All DCOMDRAW clients see the same drawing and any client
can take ownership of the pen to draw. The user of DCOMDRAW can use a
mouse or tablet device to draw in the client window and can choose the
color and width of the electronic ink. As clients draw, the application
echoes the drawing activity from DCDSERVE to all connected clients using
DCOM over the network. Although these samples do not build an optimized
and complete application, the functionality is suggestive of the shared
whiteboards offered by some workgroup applications.

In addition to providing a standard way to construct applications from
re-usable software components, COM technology fosters a strong
architectural separation between client and server. This separation has
been the repeated pattern in previous samples of this series. For example,
the STOSERVE server houses a COPaper COM object that is used by the
STOCLIEN client. Although they are a client/server pair, the STOCLIEN and
STOSERVE samples use an in-process server for the COPaper COM object. With
the DCOMDRAW and DCDSERVE client/server samples the architectural
separation between client and server is retained but the COPaper COM
object is housed in an out-of-process server, DCDSERVE. COPaper implements
a custom ISharePaper interface to permit multiple clients to use the
COPaper object simultaneously. The application also requires a DCDMARSH
server to provide standard marshaling for the custom interfaces used
across process and machine boundaries.

Although DCOMDRAW, DCDSERVE, and DCDMARSH can work on the same machine
across process boundaries, the main goal is to provide a distributed
application that enables multiple DCOMDRAW clients on different machines
to access a shared single drawing object housed in a DCDSERVE server
running on a common server machine. A typical scenario would have numerous
client machines hooked to an intranet consisting of a Windows NT network
domain or peer-to-peer workgroup. DCOMDRAW can then run on any of these
client machines. DCDSERVE is installed and runs on a common server machine
in the domain. The user of the DCOMDRAW client can interactively choose
the remote server machine to determine which DCDSERVE COM server to use
for the shared drawing.

Like the STOSERVE sample, which provided the CLSID_DllPaper component,
DCDSERVE provides the CLSID_SharePaper component. Using this component,
DCDSERVE uses the SharePaper comonent to manage a shared, single COPaper
COM object that models a sheet of white drawing paper. Interface methods
on COPaper objects enable free-form drawing on the paper surface using
"ink" of specified color and width. This functionality is
outwardly similar to the "scribble" tutorial samples in many
versions of the Microsoft Visual C++ product. The electronic drawing
paper features of COPaper objects are available to clients through a
custom ISharePaper interface. COPaper implements the ISharePaper
interface. A clear architectural distinction is kept between client and
server. No graphical user interface (GUI) is provided by COPaper. Instead,
the COPaper object relies on the client for all GUI behavior. COPaper
encapsulates only the server-based capture and storage of the drawn ink
data.

The ink data that is drawn on the COPaper surface can be stored in and
loaded from compound files. The ISharePaper::Save and ISharePaper::Load
method implementations in COPaper use structured storage to store the
current data of the shared drawing in a compound file kept with DCDSERVE
on the machine acting as the common server.

The primary focus of this sample is how to construct a single, shared, and
thread-safe COM object on the server side and how to take care of DCOM
security in the networked context of multiple clients of that shared
object. The sample covers both process and activation DCOM security. A
simple shared drawing sample is used to study these issues in a
Distributed COM client/server application.

COPaper is housed in an out-of-process server and is made publicly
available as a custom COM component. Like all other servers in this
tutorial series, DCDSERVE.EXE is a self-registering COM server. It makes
the COPaper object type available to clients as the SharePaper component
using a CLSID_SharePaper registration in the Registry.

As was the case in the previous STOSERVE server, the COPaper object in
DCDSERVE supports connectable-object features. COPaper exposes the
IConnectionPointContainer interface and implements an appropriate
connection point. In this context, an outgoing custom IPaperSink interface
is declared for use in sending notifications to the DCOMDRAW client. The
use of COM connection-point technology in this sample is significant
because it is used in a DCOM setting across machine boundaries. The
connection points are used to echo highly interactive mouse-motion events
across the network to DCOMDRAW clients that are connected to the same
COPaper drawing. Despite the overhead of DCOM, RPC, and marshaling, the
DCDSERVE and DCOMDRAW samples demonstrate that COM's connectable-object
technology can play a role in DCOM-based applications.

The two ISharePaper and IPaperSink custom interfaces are declared in
PAPINT.H, which is located in the common INC directory. PAPINT.H is
automatically generated in the DCDMARSH sample. The GUIDs for the
interfaces and objects are defined in PAPGUIDS.H located in that same
directory.

The CThreaded facility in APPUTIL is used by DCDSERVE to achieve thread
safety, as it was in the FRESERVE sample. COPaper objects are derived from
the CThreaded class and inherit its OwnThis and UnOwnThis methods. These
methods allow only one thread at a time to have access to the DCDSERVE
server and to the shared single COPaper object managed by the server.
Because the Single Threaded Apartment (STA) model is in effect for both
DCDSERVE and DCOMDRAW, this thread safety is not actually needed for
COPaper but is still appropriate for the DCDSERVE server housing.

Because client and server run in separate processes--usually on different
machines--both DCDSERVE and DCOMDRAW rely on standard marshaling for the
ISharePaper and IPaperSink custom interfaces. This support is provided by
the DCDMARSH code sample, so you must also build (or otherwise register)
DCDMARSH.DLL on both machines prior to building and running DCDSERVE and
DCOMDRAW across machines.

To set up for the proper operation of a DCOMDRAW client on one machine to
control the common DCDSERVE server on another, both machines must have
DCOM (Distributed COM) installed. DCOM is included in Windows NT 4.0 or
later and in Windows 98. For Windows 95 you must install the DCOM95 add
on. The multiple machines must be connected in a properly configured
network. For details on setting up a network, see your Windows NT product
documentation or the Windows NT Resource Kit. For more details on machine
and network setup for running with DCOM, see also the "Network and
Setup Issues" section at the end of the REMCLIEN lesson. Note that
the less restrictive security in Windows 95 and Windows 98 prevents the
SCM under DCOM from automatically launching DCDSERVE on behalf of a remote
DCOMDRAW client. You must manually pre-launch DCDSERVE on these operating
systems if you are attempting a remote load of DCDSERVE from a DCOMDRAW
running on another machine. The DCDSERVE and DCOMDRAW lessons assume that
you install DCDSERVE.EXE on a machine running Windows NT Server or
Workstation.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of DCDSERVE, see the
Code Tour section in DCDSERVE.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of DCDSERVE, see the Usage section in DCDSERVE.HTM. To
read DCDSERVE.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the DCDSERVE lesson in the table of lessons. You can do the same
thing in the Windows Explorer by double-clicking the DCDSERVE.HTM file
after locating the main tutorial directory. For more details on the
DCOMDRAW client and how it works with DCDSERVE.DLL, see DCOMDRAW.HTM in
the main tutorial directory. You must build DCDSERVE.DLL before building
or running DCOMDRAW.

DCDSERVE's makefile automatically registers DCDSERVE's SharePaper COM
component in the registry. This component must be registered before
DCDSERVE is available to outside COM clients as a server for that
component. To register the SharePaper component, the makefile uses the
REGISTER.EXE utility built in the REGISTER sample. Therefore you must
build the REGISTER sample before you can build or run DCDSERVE.

For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.


Usage
-----

The DCDSERVE executable is meant to be used as an out-of-process COM
server. Out-of-process servers like DCDSERVE are registered in the system
registry, and DCDSERVE has built-in support for registering its
components. It accepts the following command line switches to register and
unregister:
