<h2><a name="APPUTIL">APPUTIL - Win32 Application Utility Library</a></h2>

<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>
The APPUTIL library provides utility classes and functions that are useful
for making simple C++ Win32 Windows applications. This library is used
extensively in all the COM Tutorial Samples and is provided as
&quot;Lesson 0&quot; in the tutorial sequence. It is worth reviewing
briefly before plunging into the other samples.

<P>
APPUTIL provides a minimal application framework for building Win32
applications. For example, such convenient C++ abstract base classes as
CVirWindow and CVirDialog are provided to ease the creation of application
windows and dialogs. Much of APPUTIL is also concerned with utility
functions that add support in sample applications for tutorial behavior.
For example, one significant set of functionality is a trace logging
facility (see the CMsgLog and CSendLog classes) that allows the samples
under study to more clearly reveal their internal behavior.

<p>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of APPUTIL, see the
Code Tour section in APPUTIL.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of APPUTIL, see the Usage section in APPUTIL.HTM. To
read APPUTIL.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the APPUTIL lesson in the table of lessons. You can also achieve the
same thing by clicking the APPUTIL.HTM file after locating the main
tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer.

<p>
For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE
is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

<h4>Usage</h4>

<P>
APPUTIL.LIB is meant to be statically linked to modules (.EXEs or .DLLs)
that use it. You include APPUTIL.H in the module that uses features of
APPUTIL.LIB. You must also include APPUTIL.LIB in the LINK command of your
application's makefile. For an example of the use of APPUTIL.LIB, see the
READTUT code sample.

<h4>Classes</h4>
The classes provided are: CVirWindow, CVirDialog, CAboutBox, CDelayBox,
CMsgBox, CMsgLog, CSendLog, and CThreaded.

<h4>Functions</h4>

<P>
The functions provided are: WindowProc, DialogProc, AnsiToUc, UcToAnsi,
DComOk, lRandom, CreateColorScalePalette, PaintWindow, SkipAnsi,
FileExist, MakeFamilyPath, CmdExec, DelayBox, ErrorBox, GetErrorMsg,
HrMsg, HrMsgId, ReadHelp, ReadTutorial, GoWeb, ReadSource, GetErrorMsg,
and OutputDebugFmt.

<P>
There are also a series of A_ ANSII versions of COM/OLE service helper
functions. The A_ functions are used in conjunction with a matching series
of macros in APPUTIL.H to permit compilation of the code samples under
both ANSII (default) and UNICODE. These macros and matching A_ functions
are for service calls that only accept Unicode string parameters. For
example, the standard StgIsStorageFile function only accepts a Unicode
string. When compiling a sample for ANSII (ie, UNICODE is not defined), a
macro replaces any StgIsStorageFile calls with A_StgIsStorageFile calls.
A_StgIsStorageFile is implemented here in APPUTIL. A_StgIsStorageFile
takes the input ANSII string that is passed and converts it into a Unicode
string prior to making a call to the actual StgIsStorageFile system
function.

 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
An abstract base class, CVirWindow, is declared in APPUTIL.H as an aid in
treating a window as a C++ object. Using the CVirWindow class, a window
procedure can directly access class members by dereferencing a pointer to
an object instance of this class. Through GWL_USERDATA in GetWindowLong
and SetWindowLong, the WindowProc member function has access to the
pointer. The global WindowProc function is still used, but this scheme
allows the global function to forward most message handling to the
&quot;this&quot; WindowProc member function of a specific object instance
of CVirWindow. The global WindowProc receives the &quot;this&quot; pointer
as the lpCreateParams member passed as part of the WM_NCCREATE message. It
saves the &quot;this&quot; pointer in the GWL_USERDATA field of the window
structure.

<P>
An abstract base class, CVirDialog, which is similar to CVirWindow, is
also declared as an aid in treating a dialog box as a C++ object. Using
the CVirDialog class, a dialog box procedure can directly access class
members by dereferencing a pointer to an object instance of this class.
Through GWL_USERDATA in GetWindowLong and SetWindowLong, the DialogProc
member function has access to the &quot;this&quot; pointer. The global
DialogProc function is still used, but this scheme allows the global
function to defer most message handling to the DialogProc member function
of a specific object instance of CVirDialog.  The functionality is very
similar to CVirWindow described above.

<P>
The CAboutBox class is declared to allow creation of a common About dialog
box in applications. The class is derived from the CVirDialog abstract
class and illustrates its use.

<P>
The CDelayBox class is declared to allow creation of a common dialog box
in applications that have no buttons and appear on screen for a delay
period. The class is derived from the CVirDialog abstract class.

<P>
The CMsgBox class is declared to provide simple message boxes to display
error and notice messages. The message strings in the message box can be
specified as string literals, string variables, or resource string
identifiers. The Error and Note methods take string literals or string
variables. The ErrorID and NoteID methods take resource string
identifiers. In addition, the Notice message box methods have variants
that support message string formatting in the style of the C standard
library function printf. These member functions support a variable
argument list, NoteFmt, and NoteFmtID.

<P>
The CMsgLog class is declared to provide a facility for logging debug
trace messages to a Listbox control. This class is for code samples that
use debug messages to announce internal activity in the code being
studied. This message log listbox can be directed to occupy the entire
client area of the parent window. An argument to the Create method
determines whether the log occupies a detached child window or the entire
client area as an integral child window. Message output member functions
can use either string resource identifier arguments to retrieve the
message strings from the application's resources, or string variables to
retrieve the message strings directly. The CMsgLog::MsgFmt method is
provided to allow message formatting in the style of the C standard
library function wsprintf. This member function supports a variable
argument list. The CMsgLog::Copy method is provided to copy the entire
contents of the message log to the Windows Clipboard.

<P>
The CMsgLog logging facility is for examining the tutorial code samples.
It works in parallel with the standard OutputDebugString capability. If
you are compiling with NODEBUG=1, the debug output is not compiled. In
this case, logging support is still available, because it is an integral
part of the code sample itself. When compiling for debugging, both outputs
are provided for flexibility. Most C++ debuggers have an output window
that will display the debug output strings, but the logging facility works
whether or not you are running the application under a debugger.

<P>
The CSendLog trace logging facility is also provided. It operates much
like the CMsgLog facility, except that it is intended for an application
that logs its activity to an application running in another process. This
facility is useful in an out-of-process local server that logs its
internal behavior to a display in a client .EXE. CSendLog uses the Win32
SendMessage function with the WM_COPYDATA message to send a block of text
data from one process to another. CSendLog duplicates some of the
capability of CMsgLog by allowing a local server to have its own log
display. The destination of the logging can therefore be switched between
the client's logging display and the local server's logging display by
calling the LogToServer method.

<P>
The CThreaded class is provided as a utility base class for providing
functionality in derived classes that offer mutually exclusive access
among multiple threads to data in objects of the derived class. Derive
your class from CThreaded to inherit these features. A typical example of
a method in the derived class that exploits these features follows.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  void CServer::Unlock(void)
  {
    if (OwnThis())
    {
      m_cLocks -= 1;
      if (m_cLocks &lt; 0)
        m_cLocks = 0;
      if (0L == m_cObjects &amp;&amp; 0L == m_cLocks &amp;&amp; IsWindow(m_hWndServer))
        PostMessage(m_hWndServer, WM_CLOSE, 0, 0L);

      UnOwnThis();
    }
    return;
  }
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This Unlock method implements numerous thread-safe accesses and changes to
the guarded m_cLocks member variable. CServer was derived public from
CThreaded. Two CThreaded methods are of value here: OwnThis and UnOwnThis
are virtual functions in CThreaded that have default defintions that
enforce mutually exclusive access to data in objects of the derived class
(like CServer here). You use bracketed pairs of these OwnThis and
UnOwnThis methods, as above, to code the protection. OwnThis blocks the
currently executing thread until the currently owning thread executes the
UnOwnThis method. OwnThis returns true if ownership is granted. See the
CThreaded method definitions in APPUTIL.CPP for more details.

<P>
Some general utility functions and macros provided by APPUTIL are briefly
described below.

<P>
COM often deals with parameters that are pointers to pointers (void**). To
capture this as a type, a PPVOID typedef is provided.

<P>
The DELETE_POINTER macro deletes the object pointed to by a pointer and
sets the pointer to NULL.

<P>
The RELEASE_INTERFACE macro releases a pointer to an interface and sets
the pointer to NULL. Use this carefully. If you have to perform a sequence
of releases on the same interface don't use this macro because it NULLs
the interface pointer and thus prevents any subsequent releases. Use it
to perform the last release on an interface to a COM object.

<P>
Two utility functions are provided for string conversion between ANSII and
Unicode strings. AnsiToUc converts an ANSII 'multi-byte' string to a
Unicode 'wide character' string. UcToAnsi converts a Unicode string to an
ANSII string.

<P>
The DComOk function detects whether the DCOM (Distributed COM) capability
is installed on the system. It checks to ensure that the CoInitializeEx
function is exported from the OLE32.DLL system library. CoInitializeEx was
initially supplied with the DCOM functionality in Windows NT 4.0 and its
presence is thus a simple way to confirm that DCOM is present. Simularly,
DComOk will return FALSE on Windows 95 if the DCOM95 add-on is not
installed.

<P>
lRandom is a simple DWORD pseudo-random number generator.

<P>
Two utility functions are provided for creating color scale palettes and
for painting windows with such colors: CreateColorScalePalette and
PaintWindow. Lifted from the GDIDEMO sample in the Win32 samples of the
Platform SDK. They are used in these tutorial samples to add color
background to dialogs like the standard Aboutbox dialog.

<P>
The SkipAnsi function scans an input ANSI string and either skips white
characters or non-white characters. The string pointer after the skip
operation is returned.

<P>
The FileExist utility function indicates whether a specified file exists.

<P>
The MakeFamilyPath utility function uses GetModuleFileName to dynamically
determine the path to the module currently executing and construct a
family variant of that path with the proper file name extension for a
particular purpose. Various such extensions (for example, .HLP, .HTM,
.TXT, and .LIC) are defined in APPUTIL.H for use with this MakeFamilyPath
function. If the EXE program executing MakeFamilyPath is
D:\MYPATH\MYAPP.EXE then MakeFamilyPath can be used to construct such
filenames as D:\MYPATH\MYAPP.HTM.

<P>
The GetExeName function gets the executable file name of the currently
executing module. The caller must allocate a string big enough for
long file names (typically MAX_PATH characters long). This function
returns file names like: MyApp.EXE and MyDynamicLinkLibrary.DLL.

<P>
The DelayBox function uses a specified dialog template from the calling
application's resources and shows a buttonless dialog message box that
remains on screen for about 3 seconds. You can set the delay period at
compile time using DELAYBOX_DURATION in APPUTIL.H.

<P>
The ErrorBox function displays an error message dialog box. It displays an
error message string in the dialog that is specified in the call by a
resource ID.

<P>
The HrMsg function is used to display an Error Message box. The function
takes a standard HRESULT result code, looks it up in the system error
string tables, and shows the hex error code with the retrieved system
error message string. HrMsg accepts an additional user message string that
is displayed in the Message Box. The HrMsgId function does the same as the
HrMsg function except that the user message string is specified as a
resource ID rather than a string pointer.

<P>
The ReadTutorial function is for use by tutorial code sample applications
that study themselves. This function uses the shell to launch the Web
browser to read an HTML Web page that contains a tutorial covering the
sample. If no HTM file (in a sibling or parent directory) is specified,
this function assumes a family-named &lt;sample&gt;.HTM tutorial HTML file
that is located next to the main .EXE file of the code sample.
Family-named means that if the EXE program calling this function is
MYAPP.EXE then the associated family-named HTML file is constructed as
MYAPP.HTM. The function accepts a pointer to an optional HTML FileName
string. If this pointer is NULL, then the family-named file is used for
the HTML file and is assumed to be located next to the main .EXE file of
the program executing this function. Non-NULL values are of the form
MySiblingDirectory\MyHTMLFile.HTM or of the form
MyHTMLFileInTheParentDirectory.HTM. Special non-NULL values beginning with
'.' (eg. .HTM or .ASP) specify that the family-named file is assumed to be
located in the parent directory. In this case, the specified file
extension is used.

<P>
The GoWeb function is used to launch the Web browser on a specified HTML
file via either a URL or a full file path/name. It accepts a pointer to
the target specification string that must be ANSI. If this pointer is NULL
then GoWeb simply calls ReadTutorial function (above). If the target
starts with '//' then the target is assumed to be a www URL trailer of the
form: //www.microsoft.com. If the target is any other string, then it is
assumed to be a full HTML path/file name.

<P>
The ReadSource utility function is provided to display the Open common
dialog box so the user can select any of the source files for the current
code sample and start a reader on that file. The Windows Notepad
(NOTEPAD.EXE) is the default reader. You can specify a different reader by
modifying EDITOR_FILE_STR in APPUTIL.H

<P>
The GetErrorMsg function accepts a standard Win32 error code (i.e., an
HRESULT SCODE) and retrieves the human readable system error message
string that corresponds to that error code.

<P>
The OutputDebugFmt utility function is provided to support formatted
(printf-style) variable argument output to the debugger. This function
wraps the standard OutputDebugString function.

<P>
A set of debug output macros is provided to obtain source file and line
number information for the debug output. These macros use the function
OutputDebugFmt to support variable argument lists in the format of the
debug output display string. The debug output macros are:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  <u>Macro Description</u>
  ODS   Output debug string literal.
        Example:  ODS(&quot;String Literal&quot;).
  ODFn  Output formatted debug string using printf-style format string
        and a variable argument list to correspond to the format.
        Examples: ODF1(&quot;Integer=%i&quot;, iInteger);
                  ODF2(&quot;Integer=%i String=%s \r\n&quot;, iInteger, szString);
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
A set of debug trace logging macros is provided to obtain source file and
line number information for the debug output while also logging these
messages to a built-in CMsgLog message logging facility in the
application. These macros also output the same messages to the debugger
using the standard OutputDebugString call. These are convenience macros to
perform both the message logging that the application requires and to
output the same messages to the debugger, if the application was compiled
for debugging and you are running it under a debugger aware of such
output. Like the ODFn macros, these macros form a series. For the string
literal arguments, do not use the TEXT macro--it is provided inside the
macro.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  <u>Macro     Description</u>
  LOG       Log a string literal message.
            Example: LOG(&quot;String Literal&quot;);
  LOGFn     Log a formatted message using printf-style format string
            and a variable argument list to correspond to the format.
            Examples: LOGF1(&quot;Integer=%i&quot;, iInteger);
                      LOGF2(&quot;Integer=%i String=%s \r\n&quot;, iInteger, szString);
  LOGID     Log a message string retrieved from the module's resources.
            Example:  LOGID(ID_OF_MY_STRING_IN_THE_RESOURCES);
  LOGERROR  Check an error code and if it is an error then fetch the matching
            error string message from the system tables and log the error.
            Example: LOGERROR(&quot;SysApiThatWasCalled:&quot;, ErrorCodeReturned);
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The CKHR macro is provided as a convenient way to check standard COM
HRESULT return codes. If the return code is an error then this macro uses
the HrMsg function to display a message box with the system error
description associated with that error code.
