<h2><a name="READTUT">READTUT - Tutorial Reader and Linking to APPUTIL</a></h2>

<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
The READTUT sample builds a simple READTUT.EXE application that is used as
the main utility for reading the online tutorial for the COM Tutorial
Samples. The TUTORIAL.EXE utility, found in the main tutorial directory,
is produced in this sample. To do this, a copy of READTUT.EXE is simply
renamed to TUTORIAL.EXE and placed in the main tutorial directory where it
provides the main tutorial entry for the entire lesson series.

<P>
This lesson illustrates:
<ul>
<li>a very simple Win32 EXE application that links to the APPUTIL library
    and uses utility functions in it. APPUTIL is linked to and used in
    this manner throughout the tutorial sample series.

<li>how the main TUTORIAL.EXE tutorial reader application is made.

<li>the technique used by each tutorial sample to read the tutorial page
    for that sample from within the running sample.

</ul>

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of READTUT, see the
Code Tour section in READTUT.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of READTUT, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
READTUT.HTM. To read READTUT.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the READTUT lesson in the table of lessons. You can
also achieve the same thing by clicking the READTUT.HTM file after
locating the main tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer.

<P>
In general, to set up your system to build and test the code samples in
this COM Tutorial series, see the global TUTORIAL.HTM file for
details. The accompanying makefile (MAKEFILE) is Microsoft
NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE command in the
Command Prompt window.

<P>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<P>
READTUT.EXE is an application that you can run directly from Windows or
from the Command Prompt. READTUT can be run in one of the following forms.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
    READTUT
      Launches the Web browser to read file READTUT.HTM in the same
      directory as the executing READTUT.EXE. If READTUT.EXE is renamed to
      TUTORIAL.EXE then file TUTORIAL.HTM will be read in the same manner.

    READTUT MyHTMLFile.HTM
      Launches the Web browser to read file MyHTMLFile.HTM in the main
      tutorial directory. This directory is assumed to be the parent of
      the directory where READTUT.EXE is executing.

    READTUT MySiblingDir\MyHTMLFile.HTM
      Launches the Web browser to read MyHTMLFile.HTM in the MySiblingDir
      directory that is a sibling to the directory where READTUT.EXE is
      executing.

    READTUT //www.mycompany.com
      Launches the Web browser with URL internet address
      http://www.mycompany.com.
 </FONT> </PRE>

<h4>Run the Sample</h4>

<p>
READTUT.EXE must be compiled before you can run it. For more details on
building the samples, see
<a href="using.htm#building">
 Building the Code Samples.</a>

<P>
If you have already built the READTUT sample, you can simply run
READTUT.EXE in a command window. A small tutorial home page, READTUT.HTM,
is provided in the READTUT sample directory. This test page is viewed by
READTUT.EXE when it is run. You can also run READTUT.EXE directly from
here in the tutorial.

<a href="readtut\readtut.exe">
Click here to run READTUT.EXE.</a>

<P>
Depending on the security level of your browser you may see a dialog
allowing you to either open the .EXE file or save it to disk. Click the
"Open it" choice and then click the OK button.

<p>&#160;
<h3>OPERATION</h3>

<P>
The READTUT application operates transparently except when an error occurs.
If an error occurs, a modal error dialog box is displayed with one of the
following errors:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  READTUT.EXE: COM initialization failed.
  READTUT.EXE: Can't find HTM file.
  READTUT.EXE: Can't run browser.
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>&#160;
<h3>CODE TOUR</h3>

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
<u>Files          Description</u>
READTUT.TXT   Short description of sample.
READTUT.HTM   Short sample HTML home page for testing READTUT.EXE.
MAKEFILE      The generic makefile for building the code sample.
READTUT.H     The include file for the READTUT application. Contains
              string literals and Resource identifiers.
READTUT.CPP   The main implementation file for READTUT.EXE. Has WinMain.
READTUT.RC    The application resource definition file.
READTUT.ICO   The application icon resource.
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The READTUT.EXE utility in this lesson is used to launch the system Web
browser on a specified (or asssumed) HTML Web page file. READTUT is so
simple that no main window or message loop is required. The only user
interface that might be encountered is a set of message dialog boxes to
notify the user of progress or error conditions.

<P>
The main content of the program is in READTUT.CPP. The following fragment
contains the declaration files included.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  /*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We include WINDOWS.H for all Win32 applications.
    We include OLE2.H because we will be calling the COM/OLE Libraries.
    We include APPUTIL.H because we will be building this application using
      the utility functions in the APPUTIL Library (ie, APPUTIL.LIB).
    We include READTUT.H because it has resource definitions specific to
      this tutorial application.

  #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
  #include &lt;ole2.h&gt;
  #include &lt;apputil.h&gt;
  #include &quot;readtut.h&quot;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
WINDOWS.H is included because this is a Win32 Windows application. OLE2.H
is included because calls will be made to such COM/OLE functions as
CoInitialize and CoUninitialize. APPUTIL.H is located in the common
sibling include directory, INC. It is included by almost all samples in
this series as a very thin Win32 application framework. APPUTIL also
contains many utility functions that are used to help samples expose their
inner behavior for tutorial purposes. See APPUTIL.HTM for details.
READTUT.H is included for resource IDs and string literals that are unique
to READTUT.

<P>
All the work of READTUT is done in the WinMain function in READTUT.CPP.

      iFail = TRUE;
    }

    return iFail;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Because this application will likely make calls to COM services, the
program calls COM's CoInitialize function to initialize the COM service
libraries. This CoInitialize call must be paired with a matching
CoUninitialize call that is made above near the end of WinMain.

<P>
The program displays a simple message box for several seconds to notify
the user that the Web browser is being launched. The DelayBox utility
function in APPUTIL is called to do this. Notice that a dialog resource
from the executing READTUT module is used for the buttonless dialog that
appears. That dialog definition is found in READTUT.RC and is identified
by the IDD_LOADING_MSG resource ID. That ID is #defined in include file
READTUT.H. The Win32 MAKEINTRESOURCE macro is used to convert an ID number
into a resource name string which the DelayBox function requires to
specify a dialog template.

<P>
The program then scans its own command line to determine the kind of HTML
target that the Web browser will be directed to browse.

<P>
With the psz string pointer variable assigned to point to the command line
input argument string, the above while loop in WinMain uses the SkipAnsi
function to skip white space and any command line switches. The SkipAnsi
function is a utility function defined in the APPUTIL library. SkipAnsi
can either skip over whitespace characters or skip over non-whitespace
characters. This is determined by the value of TRUE or FALSE for the
second parameter. Note that SkipAnsi only accepts ANSI character string
pointers. This is because the pszCmdLine command line string is available
to WinMain only in ANSI regardless of whether this program is compiled for
Unicode. See APPUTIL.HTM for more details on SkipAnsi.

<P>
The program then calls either the APPUTIL ReadTutorial or GoWeb functions
based on whether an HTML target was specified on the command line. When
ch == 0 above then no target was specified.

<P>
The ReadTutorial function launches the Web browser to read a specified
.HTM file. ReadTutorial is in the APPUTIL library. ReadTutorial calls
another APPUTIL function, ReadHelp, to perform the actual launch of the
Web browser. Here is ReadHelp from APPUTIL.CPP in the sibling APPUTIL
directory.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  void ReadHelp(
         HWND hWndOwner,
         LPTSTR pszHelpFile)
  {
    int iRes;

    if (NULL != pszHelpFile)
    {
      // First check if the .HTM help file is there at all.
      if (FileExist(pszHelpFile))
      {
        // Use shell to invoke web browser on the HTML help file.
        iRes = (int) ShellExecute(
                       hWndOwner,
                       TEXT(&quot;open&quot;),
                       pszHelpFile,
                       NULL,
                       NULL,
                       SW_SHOWNORMAL);
        if (iRes &lt;= 32)
        {
          // If unable to browse then put up an error box.
          HrMsg(hWndOwner, TEXT(NOBROWSE_ERROR_STR), E_FAIL);
        }
      }
      else
      {
        // If the .HTM file doesn't exist the put up an error box.
        iRes = MessageBox(
                 hWndOwner,
                 TEXT(NOHTM_ERROR_STR),
                 TEXT(ERROR_TITLE_STR),
                 MB_OK | MB_ICONEXCLAMATION);
      }
    }

    return;
  }
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Using a call to the Win32 ShellExecute function, ReadHelp uses the
operating system Shell to launch the current system Web browser on a
specified HTML file. This action relies on a current file type association
that establishes an installed Web browser as the agent that handles .HTM
files. It assumes that a Web browser is installed and that the file
association was set up during the install process.

<P>
Usually the READTUT.EXE program will have no target specified on the
command line. In such a case, APPUTIL's ReadTutorial function is called
with a NULL for the HTML target parameter. As a result, ReadTutorial
determines the path and file name of the EXE in which it is executed and
uses that information to construct the path and name of the target HTML
file. Thus, if READTUT.EXE resides in directory
D:\MSSDK\SAMPLES\COM\TUTSAMP\READTUT it will launch the Web browser to
view the file D:\MSSDK\SAMPLES\COM\TUTSAMP\READTUT\READTUT.HTM. Such a
small HTML page is provided as file READTUT.HTM in the READTUT sample
directory. This initial HTML page is the entry to a potentialy large
tutorial.

<P>
As another example, if READTUT.EXE is copied to directory
D:\MSSDK\SAMPLES\COM\TUTSAMP, renamed to TUTORIAL.EXE, and executed, then
TUTORIAL.EXE will launch the Web browser to browse file
D:\MSSDK\SAMPLES\COM\TUTSAMP\TUTORIAL.HTM. This is what was actually done
to provide TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory of this sample
series. TUTORIAL.EXE is just a renamed copy of READTUT.EXE.

<P>
The program calls GoWeb when an HTML target was specified on the READTUT
command line. The GoWeb function accepts a pointer to an ANSI string that
specifies the target HTML file. If the target is of the form
//www.mycompany.com, then GoWeb detects this and launches the Web browser
using a complete world wide Web internet URL address of the form
http://www.mycompany.com. If the specified target string does not have a
leading '//' then a full path and file name for the local file system is
assumed and GoWeb launches the Web browser using that full specification.
