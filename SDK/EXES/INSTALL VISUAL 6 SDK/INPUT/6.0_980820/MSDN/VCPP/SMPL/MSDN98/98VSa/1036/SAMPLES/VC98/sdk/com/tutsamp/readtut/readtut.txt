READTUT - Tutorial Reading Utility.


SUMMARY
=======

The READTUT sample builds a simple READTUT.EXE application that is used as
the main utility for reading the online tutorial for the COM Tutorial
Samples. The TUTORIAL.EXE utility, found in the main tutorial directory,
is produced in this sample. To do this, a copy of READTUT.EXE is simply
renamed to TUTORIAL.EXE and placed in the main tutorial directory where it
provides the main tutorial entry for the entire series. This lesson shows
the technique used by each tutorial sample to read the tutorial page for
that sample from within the running sample. This lesson also shows a very
simple Win32 EXE application that links to the APPUTIL library and uses
utility functions in it. APPUTIL is linked to and used in this manner
throughout the tutorial sample series.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of READTUT, see the
Code Tour section in READTUT.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of READTUT, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
READTUT.HTM. To read READTUT.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the READTUT lesson in the table of lessons. You can
also achieve the same thing by clicking the READTUT.HTM file after
locating the main tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer.

In general, to set up your system to build and test the code samples in
this COM Tutorial series, see the global TUTORIAL.HTM file for details.
The accompanying makefile (MAKEFILE) is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To
create a debug build, issue the NMAKE command in the Command Prompt
window.

Usage
-----

READTUT.EXE is an application that you can run directly from Windows or
from the Command Prompt. READTUT can be run in one of the following forms.

    READTUT
      Launches the web browser to read file READTUT.HTM in the same
      directory as the executing READTUT.EXE. If READTUT.EXE is renamed to
      TUTORIAL.EXE then file TUTORIAL.HTM will be read in the same manner.

    READTUT MyHTMLFile.HTM
      Launches the web browser to read file MyHTMLFile.HTM in the main
      tutorial directory. This directory is assumed to be the parent of
      the directory where READTUT.EXE is executing.

    READTUT MySiblingDir\MyHTMLFile.HTM
      Launches the web browser to read MyHTMLFile.HTM in the MySiblingDir
      directory that is a sibling to the directory where READTUT.EXE is
      executing.

    READTUT //www.mycompany.com
      Launches the web browser with URL internet address
      http://www.mycompany.com.
