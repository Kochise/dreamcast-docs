Message Compiler


SUMMARY
=======

The MC tool takes a message definition script as input, and writes out a 
binary message table. It can be useful for obtaining a more complete 
understanding of message tables.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is an additional sample distributed with the Win32 SDK CD that 
demonstrates how an application can make use of message tables. It may be 
found in the following directory: Q_A\SAMPLES\MSGTABLE.
