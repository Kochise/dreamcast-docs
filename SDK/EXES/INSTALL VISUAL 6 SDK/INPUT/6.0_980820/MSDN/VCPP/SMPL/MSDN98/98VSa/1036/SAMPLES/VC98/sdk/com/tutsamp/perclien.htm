<h2><a name="PERCLIEN">PERCLIEN - Client of Persistent Object Servers</a></h2>

<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
The PERCLIEN sample completes a sequence of four samples that cover
persistent COM objects. The first three samples discuss three COM servers
that each house COM objects having a different kind of object persistence.
The first sample, PERSERVE, shows how to use the IPersistStream interface
to give COPageList COM objects their persistence in a stream of a
structured storage compound file.  The second sample, PERTEXT, shows how
to use the IPersistStreamInit interface is used to give COTextPage COM
object their persistence in streams. The IPersistStreamInit::InitNew
method is covered in detail. The third sample, PERDRAW, shows how to use
the IPersistStorage interface to give CODrawPage COM objects their
persistence in substorages of a compound file. The
IPersistStorage::HandsOffStorage and IPersistStorage::SaveCompleted
methods are covered in detail. This sample, PERCLIEN, integrates the use
of the three previous servers into a single COM client application.

<P>
The PERCLIEN client uses the components in the PERSERVE, PERTEXT, and
PERDRAW to build a document editing application that presents a list of
pages to users. The user can add, delete, open, and name the page items in
the list. When an item is opened, the content appears in a separate window
for editing. The separate edit windows are child windows of PERCLIEN's
main window. Two types of pages are supported: text pages and drawing
pages.

<P>
PERCLIEN provides the graphical user interface for editing the page list
as well as for editing the content of the two page types. PERCLIEN's
CGuiList C++ object encapsulates the editing of the page list in
PERCLIEN's main window. CGuiList controls the server-side COPageList
object in PERSERVE. PERCLIEN's CGuiText C++ object encapsulates the
editing of text pages in separate child windows. CGuiText controls the
server-side COTextPage object in PERTEXT. PERCLIEN's CGuiDraw C++ object
encapsulates the editing of drawing pages in separate child windows.
CGuiDraw controls the server-side CODrawPage object in PERDRAW.

<P>
The separate text page windows of CGuiText provide for the editing of text
using the standard Win32 multi-line edit control. The separate drawing
page windows of CGuiDraw provide the free-form line drawing functionality
that appeared in the STOSERVE and STOCLIEN samples.

<P>
The PERCLIEN sample relies on each page's persistent COM object to load
and store the page's content. PERCLIEN acquires a pointer to the
IPersistStream interface on COPageList to control persistent stream
storage of the page list. It acquires a pointer to the IPersistStreamInit
interface on COTextPage to control persistent stream storage (with InitNew
capability) of a text page. It acquires a pointer to the IPersistStorage
interface on CODrawPage to control persistent storage in a substorage
(with the HandsOffStorage protocol) of a drawing page.

<P>
PERCLIEN controls the use of the compound file and provides the COM
objects on the server side with appropriate interface pointers for the
storages or streams used to store the data. PERSERVE's COPageList COM
object exposes the IPersistStream interface and receives an IStream
pointer from PERCLIEN. PERTEXT's COTextPage COM object exposes the
IPersistStreamInit interface and receives an IStream pointer by PERCLIEN.
PERDRAW's CODrawPage COM object exposes the IPersistStorage interface and
receives an IStorage pointer by PERCLIEN. These IStorage and IStream
interfaces are not implemented inside PERCLIEN or PERSERVE: They are
implemented by the COM libraries. When a pointer to one of these
interfaces is obtained, their methods are essentially used as a set of
services to operate on areas in a compound file. If you have not used
streams (IStream) or storages (IStorage) in structured storage compound
files, see the STOSERVE and STOCLIEN samples for coverage of this topic.

<P>
PERCLIEN manages its structured storage compound file as a kind of
document file where the page list and the pages themselves are stored.
PERCLIEN loads and saves its page list, text pages, and drawing pages in
the structured storage of this compound file. The compound file has a
unique format because of the various streams and storages used. PERCLIEN
identifies these compound files as page files with a .PAG file extension.

<P>
The connectable-object technology that was shown in the CONSERVE and
CONCLIEN samples is used between PERCLIEN and the COM objects in its
servers. Thus, PERCLIEN implements custom event sink interfaces for the
connectable objects in the servers: IPageListSink, ITextPageSink, and
IDrawPageSink.

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of PERCLIEN, see the
Code Tour section in PERCLIEN.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of PERCLIEN, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
PERCLIEN.HTM. To read PERCLIEN.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the PERCLIEN lesson in the table of lessons. You can
also do same thing by double-clicking the PERCLIEN.HTM file after locating
it in the main tutorial directory in Windows Explorer. See also
PERSERVE.HTM, PERTEXT.HTM, and PERDRAW.HTM in the main tutorial directory
for more details on how these servers work and expose their services to
PERCLIEN. The makefile for each of the servers automatically registers
that server in the system registry, so you must build the PERSERVE,
PERTEXT, and PERDRAW servers before you can run PERCLIEN.

<P>
For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command at the Command Prompt.

<P>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<P>
PERCLIEN is an application that you can execute directly from Windows in
the normal manner or from the Command Prompt window. PERCLIEN accepts an
optional file name parameter on the command line. For example:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  PERCLIEN c:\pages\mynotes.pag
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Where mynotes.pag is a compound file containing pages of text and drawings
previously made by PERCLIEN. If no file name argument is specified,
PERCLIEN uses the default file name PERCLIEN.PAG and attempts to open it
in the same directory as the executing PERCLIEN.EXE.

<h4>Run the Sample</h4>

<p>
The client sample and other related samples must be compiled before
you can run the client. For more details on building the samples, see
<a href="using.htm#building">Building the Code Samples.</a>

<P>
If you have already built the appropriate samples, PERCLIEN.EXE is the
client executable to run for this sample.

<a href="perclien\perclien.exe">Click here to run PERCLIEN.EXE.</a>

<P>
Depending on the security level of your browser you may see a dialog
allowing you to either open the .EXE file or save it to disk. Click the
"Open it" choice and then click the OK button.

<p>&#160;
<h3>OPERATION</h3>

<P>
The PERCLIEN.EXE application provides the user interface for this sample.
It uses the associated but independent PERSERVE.DLL, PERTEXT.DLL, and
PERDRAW.DLL in-process servers to demonstrate both client and server use
of the persistent objects in these servers. The following summarizes the
operation from the standpoint of PERCLIEN.EXE as a COM client of those
servers.

<h4>Main Menu (Page List)</h4>

<P>
The PERCLIEN application's main window client area displays the page list
for the currently opened page file. PERCLIEN has a main menu helps the
user control the page file and items in the page list. The following menu
commands are provided.

<p>Menu Selection: File/New<br>
Displays the Save As dialog box to obtain a name and path for a new page
file to create. A default .PAG file extension for these files is assumed.
The newly created page file becomes the currently open page file. If
changes were made to the existing page file before this menu item was
chosen, a separate dialog box asks the user if the current page list (and
any other open pages) should be saved into its associated compound file.

<p>Menu Selection: File/Open<br>
Displays the Open dialog box to obtain a name and path for an existing
page file to open. A default .PAG file extension for these files is
assumed. The newly opened page file becomes the currently open page file.
If changes were made to the existing page file before this menu item was
chosen, a separate dialog box asks the user if the current page list (and
any other open pages) should be saved into its associated compound file.

<p>Menu Selection: File/Save<br>
Saves the current drawing into its associated compound file.

<p>Menu Selection: File/Save As<br>

<P>
PERCLIEN uses many of the utility classes and services provided by
APPUTIL. For more details on APPUTIL, study the APPUTIL library source
code in the common APPUTIL directory and APPUTIL.HTM in the main tutorial
directory.

<P>
This sample focuses mainly on the client's use of the persistence features
that are exposed by the persistent objects in the servers. Most of the
infrastructure that makes PERCLIEN an application is a straightforward
reuse of technology studied in previous samples and is not covered in this
lesson. For example, the drawing functionality provided in CGuiDraw
windows is very similar to the &quot;scribble&quot; functionality used in
the STOCLIEN sample. Other COM-based infastructure is present in PERCLIEN
but is not covered. For example, the connectable object sinks in PERCLIEN
are very similar to the sink mechanisms studied in several previous
samples.

<P>The major topics covered in this code tour are:

<ul>
<li>How CGuiList, CGuiText, and CGuiDraw together form the heart of
    PERCLIEN.

<li>How CGuiList and CPageFile use the IPersistStream exposed by
    COPageList in the PERSERVE server.

<li>How CGuiText uses the IPersistStreamInit exposed by COTextPage in the
    PERTEXT server.

<li>How CGuiDraw uses the IPersistStorage exposed by CODrawPage in the
    PERDRAW server.
</ul>

<h4>Client Overview</h4>

<P>
The CGuiList, CGuiText, and CGuiDraw C++ classes all encapsulate the GUI
behavior of PERCLIEN. As in previous client samples, PERCLIEN uses a
CMainWindow that derives from APPUTIL's CVirWindow abstract class.
PERCLIEN's CMainWindow::InitInstance method creates the CGuiList object.
This object in turn creates the main application window and attempts to
load a default page file. Such a load process will be covered in detail
below. With a page file loaded, a page list is displayed to the user as
the content of a standard Win32 listbox control. This control is
encapsulated in the CListWin C++ object (coded in LISTWIN.H and
LISTWIN.CPP). The displayed list shows the page number, page type, and
title of all the pages in the page file.

<P>
With a page list entry selected, the user can open the corresponding page,
which calls CGuiList::PageOpen (in GUILIST.CPP). Using the page number of
the page to be opened, PageOpen calls IPageList::Get (implemented by the
COPageList object in the PERSERVE server) to obtain the page type, title,
and data name of the page. The obtained title is used in the page list
display. The page type determines whether CGuiText or CGuiDraw is used to
create the window for the new page. Both CGuiText and CGuiDraw are C++
classes derived from APPUTIL's CVirWindow abstract class to facilitate
greatly their treatment as separate child windows of PERCLIEN's main
window.

<P>
Both text page and drawing page windows have their own menus. See
PERCLIEN.RC for the resource definitions of the menus for the list, text,
and drawing windows. The menu commands are handled by respective DoCommand
methods: for the main list window see CMainWindow::DoCommand in
PERCLIEN.CPP; for the text window see CGuiText::DoCommand in GUITEXT.CPP;
and for the drawing window see CGuiDraw::DoCommand in GUIDRAW.CPP.

<P>
Every page has a unique internal data name (for example, Text0001 or
Drawing0002) and a counter ensures this uniqueness of data names within
the page file. The data name is assigned when the page is first created.
It is stored persistently in the page list entry for each page. The data
name is also used as the name for the stream or storage located elsewhere
in the same compound file in which the page's object data is stored. The
page type determines whether a stream or storage branch is used to contain
the object's data. For the page list itself, an IStream interface is used
by COPageList's implementation of IPersistStream. For a text page, an
IStream interface is used by COTextPage's implementation of
IPersistStreamInit. For a drawing page, an IStorage interface is used by
CODrawPage's implementation of IPersistStorage.

<P>
If the page being opened is a text page, then CGuiList::PageOpen creates a
new CGuiText C++ object and calls CGuiText::OpenWin (in GUITEXT.CPP) to
create a separate text page window that has its own menu. After
the window is successfully created as a child window of PERCLIEN's main
window, OpenWin calls CGuiText::Load to restore the object's data from its
persistent storage. We will cover this load of a text page in more detail
below.

<P>
If the page being opened is a drawing page, then CGuiList::PageOpen
creates a new CGuiDraw C++ object and calls CGuiDraw::OpenWin (in
GUIDRAW.CPP) to create a separate drawing page window. This window has its
own menu. After the window is successfully created as a child window of
PERCLIEN's main window, OpenWin calls CGuiDraw::Load to restore the
object's data from its persistent storage. This load of a drawing page is
covered in more detail below.

<h4>Page List Persistence (IPersistStream)</h4>

<P>
CGuiList uses the persistence features of the COPageList object in the
PERSERVE.DLL server. It does this in CGuiList::New, CGuiList::Load,
CGuiList::Save, and CGuiList::SaveAs. These methods rely on an additional
level of encapsulation in the CPageFile C++ object. For example,
CGuiList::Load calls CPageFile::Load to load the page list. CPageFile is
the heart of PERCLIEN's management of the persistence of the page list.
The CPageFile object is first created in CGuiList::Init just after
CGuiList is created. We will tour CPageFile and see how it uses
COPageList's implementation of IPersistStream. The following is
CPageFile::New from PAGEFILE.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  HRESULT CPageFile::New(
            TCHAR* pszFileName,

            hr = CoCreateInstance(
                   m_CidPageList,
                   NULL,

<p>
The name of the compound file to create is passed to New as the first
parameter. StgCreateDocFile expects a Unicode string. When PERCLIEN is
compiled for ANSI strings (the UNICODE macro is not defined--which is the
default in the makefile), this call actually reduces to a call to an
internal APPUTIL function, A_StgCreateDocFile. This function performs the
proper conversion of the ANSI pszFile parameter to a Unicode version
before calling StgCreateDocFile. For more details, see APPUTIL.H and
STOSERVE.HTM.

<P>
The New method also receives the addresses of two output pointer
variables. When New is done, it assigns an IStorage interface pointer for
the root storage of the newly created compound file. New also assigns a
pointer to an IPageList interface on the persistent COPageList object that
is created to manage the page list data.

<P>
The COM standard StgCreateDocFile service function is called to create the
compound file in which the page list data will be saved. WriteClassStg
stores the CLSID under the root storage for the page list component,
making the page list component the main handler of data in .PAG compound
files. With a successfully created root storage, a PageList stream is
created to hold the persistent object data for COPageList objects. With
this stream created, an instance of COPageList is created on the server
side by calling CoCreateInstance. The initial interface requested is the
native IPageList interface. The COPageList object obtained from the
PERSERVE server now saves an empty copy of its persistent object data into
the newly created compound file. QueryInterface is called to obtain the
IPersistStream interface on COPageList. IPersistStream::GetSize is called
to obtain the largest size that the maximum save would consume.
IPersistStream::SetSize is then used to reserve that space in the stream.
To complete the new persistent COPageList, IPersistStream::Save is called
to save an initial copy of the object's persistent data. Since there is no
page list yet, no list array is saved, but this does save an initial set
of page list properties. Some data must be saved to blank file space even
for an &quot;empty&quot; page list. When all this is done successfully,
the caller is given a copy of the pointer to the file's root storage and a
copy of the pointer to the IPageList interface on the new COPageList
object.

<P>
If a page list compound file already exists then CPageFile::Load is called
to open the root storage of the file, create the COPageList COM object,
and load COPageList's persistent data from the storage. The following is
CPageFile::Load from PAGEFILE.CPP:

<P>
CPageFile::Load does double duty, either creating a new compound file or
opening and loading an existing one. The file path name is passed and the
StgIsStorageFile is called to determine if the file exists and is a valid
compound file. If the file does not exist or is not a valid compound file,
Load creates a new file in the same manner as in the New method above. If
the file does exist, the StgOpenStorage function opens the compound file
and obtain an IStorage interface pointer to the root storage in the file.
All the stored elements of a previously saved page list is assumed present
in the root storage branch. ReadClassStg is called to obtain the CLSID to
use in creating the persistent COPageList object. The PageList stream is
opened with the standard IStorage::OpenStream method. CoCreateInstance is
called to create the persistent COPageList object. With COPageList
created, the IPageList interface is used to QueryInterface for a pointer
to the IPersistStream interface. Using the IPersistStream interface on the
COPageList object, IPersistStream::Load directs the object to load its
persistent object data from the stream.

<P>
CPageFile::Save is called in PERCLIEN to save the currently active
COPageList persistent object. The following is CPageFile::Save from
PAGEFILE.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  HRESULT CPageFile::Save(
            IStorage* pIStorage,
            IPageList* pIPageList)

    HRESULT hr = E_POINTER;
    IStream* pIStream;
    IPersistStream* pIPersistStream;

    if (NULL != pIStorage &amp;&amp; NULL != pIPageList)
    {
      // Obtain the IPersistStream interface on the COPageList
      // COM object.
      hr = pIPageList-&gt;QueryInterface(
             IID_IPersistStream,
             (PPVOID)&amp;pIPersistStream);
      if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
      {
        // Save if the data is dirty (ie, doesn't match file data).
        if (S_FALSE != pIPersistStream-&gt;IsDirty())

            // and clear the PageList dirty bit.
            hr = pIPersistStream-&gt;Save(pIStream, TRUE);

            // Done with the stream for now so release it.

<P>
A pointer to the IStorage interface for the root storage of the currently
open page list compound file is passed as well as a pointer to the
IPageList interface for the persistent COPageList object. QueryInterface
is called on IPageList to obtain a pointer to COPageList's IPersistStream
interface. IPersistStream::IsDirty then asks the object if it needs to be
saved. (&quot;Dirty&quot; here means that the object data in RAM does not
match the data stored on file.) If the object does not need to be saved
then Save releases IPersistStream and returns without saving. If the
object does need saving then the IStorage interface is used to open the
PageList stream. Note that CPageFile holds interface pointers for the
storage and COPageList but does not retain any stream interface pointers.
CPageFile freshly opens the stream as needed and closes it when done. With
the PageList stream open, IPersistStream::Save is called on the COPageList
persistent object to direct it to save its object data.

<P>
Like CPageFile::Load discussed in the preceding section, CGuiText::Load
does double duty by either creating a new stream for the text page or
opening and loading an existing one. If the text page stream is present it
opens and loads from that stream. If the stream is not present, the stream
is created and an empty text page is written into the stream. Load assumes
the compound file is already opened and that CGuiText::m_pIStorage_Root
has the IStorage interface for the file's root storage. Load also assumes
that when CGuiText was initialized it was given the data name of the
stream where the text page data is stored. This name is kept in
CGuiText::m_wszDataName. This name is used to open or create the stream
for the text page.

<P>
IStorage::OpenStream is called and if the stream exists, the COM
ReadClassStm function is called to obtain the CLSID for the server object
that can handle text page data. This CLSID is then used in a call to the
COM CoCreateInstance function to create the COTextPage COM object in the
PERTEXT server. A pointer to the ITextPage interface is initially
requested. QueryInterface is also called to obtain a pointer to the
IPersistStreamInit interface on the new COTextPage object.
IPersistStreamInit::Load is then directs COTextPage to load its persistent
object data from the opened stream.

<P>
If IStorage::OpenStream indicates that there is no existing stream with
the name in m_wszDataName, then IStorage::CreateStream creates a new
stream of this name. Because this is a new stream, the WriteClassStm COM
function is called to store the CLSID for the class of components that can
handle text page data. The COM CoCreateInstance function is called to
create the COTextPage object in the PERTEXT server. A pointer to the
ITextPage interface is initially requested. QueryInterface is also called
to obtain a pointer to the IPersistStreamInit interface on the new
COTextPage. Because this is an entirely new instance of COTextPage the
IPersistStreamInit::InitNew method is called to initialize the new
instance in RAM. With the new instance created, IPersistStreamInit::Save
is finally used to save an empty text page into the stream. In contrast to
the IPersistStream implementation used for page lists (described above),
the InitNew method in IPersistStreamInit adds convenient provisions for
initializing the new instance of COTextPage.

<P>
CGuiText::Save is called in PERCLIEN to save a currently active COTextPage
persistent object. The following is CGuiText::Save from GUITEXT.CPP.

<P>
The stream whose name is kept in CGuiText::m_wszDataName is freshly opened
and is released at the end. The streams for text pages are not kept open
but are opened and closed as needed by CGuiText. With the existing stream
open, CGuiText::Save works with the multi-line edit control to obtain a
copy of the text of the current text page. The edit control is
encapsulated in the CTextWin C++ object. A pointer to this object is kept
in CGuiText::m_pTextWin. The text is obtained from CTextWin and
ITextPage::PutText is called to put the text into the COTextPage object.
COTextPage now has the text in RAM. QueryInterface is called to obtain a
pointer to the IPersistStreamInit interface on the COTextPage object.
IStream::Seek is called to reset the seek pointer of the stream to its
start. Finally, IPersistStreamInit::Save is called to direct the
COTextPage object to save its persistent object data to the stream.

<h4>Drawing Page Persistence (IPersistStorage)</h4>

<P>
This lesson has now explained how PERCLIEN uses the IPersistStream
interface on the persistent COPageList object to load and save the page
list, and how PERCLIEN uses the IPersistStreamInit interface on the
persistent COTextPage object to load and save text pages. This section
describes how PERCLIEN uses the IPersistStorage interface on the
persistent CODrawPage object to load and save drawing pages. The following
is CGuiDraw::Load from GUIDRAW.CPP:

<P>
Like the other load methods above, CGuiDraw::Load does double duty. It
either creates a new storage for the drawing page or it opens and loads an
existing one. If the drawing page storage is present, it opens and loads
from that storage branch. If the storage is not present, the storage is
created and an empty drawing page is written into the storage. Load
assumes the compound file is already opened and that
CGuiDraw::m_pIStorage_Root has the IStorage interface for the file's root
storage. Load also assumes that when CGuiDraw was initialized it was given
the data name of the storage where the drawing page data is stored. This
name is kept in CGuiDraw::m_wszDataName. This name is used to open or
create the storage for the drawing page.

<P>
IStorage::OpenStorage is called and if the storage exists, the COM
ReadClassStg function obtains the CLSID for the server object that can
handle drawing page data. This CLSID is then used in a call to the COM
CoCreateInstance function to create the CODrawPage COM object in the
PERDRAW server. A pointer to the IDrawPage interface is initially
requested. QueryInterface is also called to obtain a pointer to the
IPersistStorage interface on the new CODrawPage. IPersistStorage::Load is
then used to direct CODrawPage to load its persistent object data from the
opened storage.

<P>
If IStorage::OpenStorage indicates that there is no existing storage with
the name in m_wszDataName, then a new storage of this name is created.
IStorage::CreateStorage is called to perform the creation. Because this is
a new sub-storage, the WriteClassStg COM function is called to store the
CLSID for the class of components that can handle drawing page data. The
COM CoCreateInstance function is called to create the CODrawPage object in
the PERDRAW server. A pointer to the IDrawPage interface is initially
requested. QueryInterface is also called to obtain a pointer to the
IPersistStorage interface on the new CODrawPage. Since this is an entirely
new instance of CODrawPage the IPersistStorage::InitNew is called to
initialize the new CODrawPage persistent object. InitNew initializes
CODrawPage's object data in RAM and also saves this empty drawing to the
storage.

<P>
CGuiDraw::Save is called in PERCLIEN to save a currently active CODrawPage
persistent object. The followin is CGuiDraw::Save from GUIDRAW.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  HRESULT CGuiDraw::Save(
            void)

    IPersistStorage* pIPersistStorage;

    if (NULL != m_pIStorage_Page &amp;&amp; NULL != m_pIDrawPage)
    {
      // Change cursor to the hour glass.
      hCurPrev = SetCursor(hCurWait);

      // Tell the CODrawPage object to save itself
      // (via its IPersistStorage interface).
      hr = m_pIDrawPage-&gt;QueryInterface(
             IID_IPersistStorage,
             (PPVOID)&amp;pIPersistStorage);
      if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
      {
        // Perform the save with fSameAsLoad==TRUE.
        hr = pIPersistStorage-&gt;Save(m_pIStorage_Page, TRUE);
        if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
        {
          // This is the general save by the client. In the case of
          // this application the client does not need to do any other
          // intermediate save or write operations to the compound file
          // prior to informing the server that client save operations
          // are completed.
          hr = pIPersistStorage-&gt;SaveCompleted(NULL);
        }

        // Done with IPersistStorage for now so release it.
        pIPersistStorage-&gt;Release();
      }

      // Set Cursor back to what it was.
      SetCursor(hCurPrev);
    }

    return hr;
  }
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The CGuiDraw object uses the copy of the IDrawPage interface pointer it
keeps in member m_pIDrawPage to QueryInterface for a pointer to the
IPersistStorage interface on the CODrawPage object. IPersistStorage::Save
is called to direct CODrawPage to save its persistent object data to the
already opened storage (m_pIStorage_Page). Finally,
IPersistStorage::SaveCompleted is called to complete the save operation.
Other intervening save or write actions could be performed between the
Save and the SaveCompleted but are not needed in this application.
