Poker uses a paytable to determine the payoff for each winning hand.
The paytable is shown on the poker main window during game play.  The
paytable may also be adjusted by using the "Edit Paytable" option of
the side frame. </P>

On the edit paytable edit page, you will see the 10 scoring hands of
poker listed.  Beside each is the payoff for that hand,
given a bet of 1 credit.  For bets of more than 1 credit, the payoff is simply
multiplied by the bet, except for Royal Flush. </P>

Royal Flush has an extra payoff entry below the main payoff
entry.  For bets of 1-4 credits, the payoff is simply multiplied as
for the other hands.  However, for a 5 credit bet, the alternate
payoff is used, and is typically higher than 5 times the normal payoff. </P>

Besides editing the payoffs directly, you can also use one of the four
preset buttons below the payoff table.  Each will set the payoffs to a standard
casino setting, with variation in the payoff for Full House and Flush. 

A common video poker variation is to pay 1 credit for 10's or Better,
making it easier to at least win back the bet.  By pressing this
button, a pair of tens or better will pay 1 credit. </P>
