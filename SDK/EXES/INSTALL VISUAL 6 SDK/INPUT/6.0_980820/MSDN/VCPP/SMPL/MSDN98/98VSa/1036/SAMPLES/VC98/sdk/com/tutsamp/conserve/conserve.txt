CONSERVE - Connectable COM objects in an in-process server


SUMMARY
=======

The CONSERVE sample shows how to construct a connectable COM object,
COBall, in a thread-safe in-process server. To expose connectable object
features, COBall implements the standard COM interface,
IConnectionPointContainer. COBall also implements the custom interface,
IBall, that was introduced in the FRESERVE sample.

The principal focus of CONSERVE is the connectable object support in
COBall and how connected clients are notified of ball events. CONSERVE
works with the CONCLIEN client code sample.

CONSERVE's COBall implements a virtual moving ball similar to the one
coded in the FRESERVE sample. However, rather than FRESERVE's
free-threaded COM object, CONSERVE houses COBall in an apartment model
server. COBall defines the internal logic of a moving ball that exists
within a specified two-dimensional bounding rectangle. COBall provides
only a description of a ball. It is up to the client to create a graphical
representation based on the data managed in COBall.

Clients move the virtual ball using its IBall interface. COBall's internal
logic will bounce the ball when it collides with a boundary. The client
can obtain the ball's current position, size, and color to permit display
of the ball's moving image. The client can also use the connection
facilities of COBall to receive notifications of ball bounce events. The
CONCLIEN sample will use these connection facilities to produce various
sounds when the ball bounces.

CONSERVE uses the CThreaded facility in APPUTIL for thread safety, as in
the FRESERVE sample. COBall objects are derived from the CThreaded class
and inherit its OwnThis and UnOwnThis methods. These methods allow only
one thread at a time to have access to the CONSERVE server and to COBall
objects managed by the server.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of CONSERVE, see the
Code Tour section in CONSERVE.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of CONSERVE, see the Usage section in CONSERVE.HTM. To
read CONSERVE.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the CONSERVE lesson in the table of lessons. You can also achieve
the same thing by clicking the CONSERVE.HTM file after locating the main
tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also CONCLIEN.HTM in the
main tutorial directory for more details on the CONCLIEN client
application and how it works with CONSERVE.DLL. You must build
CONSERVE.DLL before building or running CONCLIEN.

CONSERVE's makefile automatically registers the DllSndBall component in
the registry. This component must be registered before CONSERVE is
available to outside clients as a server for that component. This
self-registration is done using the REGISTER.EXE utility built in the
REGISTER lesson. To build or run CONSERVE, you should build the REGISTER
code sample first.

For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

Usage
-----

To use CONSERVE, a client program does not need to include CONSERVE.H or
link to CONSERVE.LIB. A client of CONSERVE obtains access solely through
its object's CLSID and COM services. For CONSERVE, that CLSID is
CLSID_DllSndBall (defined in BALLGUID.H in the \INC sibling directory).
The CONCLIEN code sample shows how the client obtains this access.

CONSERVE is a DLL that is intended primarily as an in-process server.
Although it can be implicitly loaded by linking to its associated .LIB
file, it is normally used after an explicit LoadLibrary call, usually from
within COM's CoGetClassObject function. CONSERVE is a self-registering
in-process server.

The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the CONSERVE directory:

  nmake register

You can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the CONSERVE directory.

  ..\register\register.exe conserve.dll

These registration commands require a prior build of the REGISTER sample
in this series, as well as a prior build of CONSERVE.DLL.

In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Win32 Platform SDK and Visual C++
include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which can be used in a similar fashion to
register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.
