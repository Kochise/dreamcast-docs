<h2><a name="MARSHAL">MARSHAL - Custom Interface Standard Marshaling</a></h2>

<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
The MARSHAL sample anticipates the interaction of a client and
out-of-process server in the LOCCLIEN and LOCSERVE samples. For a client
like LOCCLIEN to use the COM objects in an out-of-process server like
LOCSERVE requires marshaling the car-related interfaces used in the
previous COM samples of this series. The MARSHAL sample creates a
proxy/stub DLL that provides standard marshaling for the ICar, IUtility,
and ICruise custom interfaces.

<P>
The Microsoft&reg; Interface Definition Language (MIDL) compiler is used
to compile the interface specifications (expressed using the MIDL language
in the MICARS.IDL file). MIDL.EXE is a utility provided as part of the
Microsoft Platform SDK. The MIDL compilation of MICARS.IDL generates
additional source files: MICARS.H, MICARS_I.C, MICARS_P.C, and DLLDATA.C.

<P>
In the series of COM Tutorial code samples, MARSHAL works with the
LOCSERVE and LOCCLIEN samples to illustrate a COM client using the
interfaces on COM objects in an out-of-process local server. In this
sample series, only standard marshaling is used for the custom ICar,
IUtility, and ICruise interfaces. Later samples in the series which use
these interfaces across apartment, process, or machine boundaries (for
example, APTSERVE, APTCLIEN, and REMCLIEN) also rely on MARSHAL.DLL for
standard marshaling of these interfaces.

<P>
The MARSHAL sample demonstrates a simple and efficient way to create a
marshaling DLL for custom interfaces. Default definitions are generated
for the DllMain, DllGetClassObject, DllCanUnloadNow, GetProxyDllInfo,
DllRegisterServer, and DllUnregisterServer functions. With this technique,
all that is needed is a makefile, a .DEF file, and an input .IDL file
specifying the interfaces. However, there may be occasions when you want
more control over the content of the marshaling DLL. For example, you may
want to perform some action within DllMain during DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, you
may want to code explicit control over the registration and unregistration
of the marshaling server, or you may want to add standard module version
information to the DLL resources. For coverage of these areas, see the
subsequent MARSHAL2 sample. MARSHAL2 produces a marshaling DLL that
marshals the same custom interfaces as MARSHAL. When registered,
MARSHAL2.DLL is functionally equivalent to MARSHAL.DLL and replaces it.
The makefile for the MARSHAL2.DLL does not automatically register the
server to achieve this replacement. You must enable this in MARSHAL2's
makefile. For the MARSHAL2 lesson, see MARSHAL2.HTM.

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of MARSHAL, see the
Code Tour section in MARSHAL.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of MARSHAL.DLL, see the Usage section in MARSHAL.HTM.
To read MARSHAL.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the MARSHAL lesson in the table of lessons. You can also do the same
thing by double-clicking the MARSHAL.HTM file after locating the main
tutorial directory in Windows Explorer. For more details on the LOCCLIEN
client and the LOCSERVE server and how MARSHAL.DLL supports their
operation, see LOCSERVE.HTM and LOCCLIEN.HTM in the main tutorial
directory. Because those code samples rely on MARSHAL.DLL, you must build
MARSHAL DLL before building or running LOCCLIEN and LOCSERVE. MARSHAL's
makefile automatically registers MARSHAL's proxy and stub interface
marshalers in the system registry. This registration must be done before
these interfaces can be used by COM clients or servers in LOCSERVE,
LOCCLIEN, and later samples of the series.

<P>
MARSHAL's self-registration is done using the REGISTER.EXE utility built
in the REGISTER sample. To build or run MARSHAL, you must build the
REGISTER code sample first.

<P>
For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE
is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

<P>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<P>
MARSHAL.DLL is built solely as a marshaling DLL for the specified
interfaces. Although it can be implicitly loaded by linking to its
associated .LIB file, it is normally used on behalf of a COM client that
is using the interfaces across apartment, process, or machine boundaries.
In these cases COM automatically loads this DLL as needed. Before COM can
find and load the MARSHAL DLL to support marshaling of its supported
interfaces, the MARSHAL server must be registered in the registry as the
marshaling server for those interfaces. MARSHAL is a self-registering
in-process server.

<P>
The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the MARSHAL directory:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  nmake register
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This assumes that you have a compilation environment set up. If not, you
can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the MARSHAL directory.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  ..\register\register.exe marshal.dll
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
These registration commands require a prior build of the REGISTER sample
in this series, as well as a prior build of MARSHAL.DLL.

<P>
In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Microsoft&reg; Platform SDK and
Visual C++&reg; include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which can be used in a
similar fashion to register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.

<P>
This code sample introduces standard marshaling of custom COM interfaces.
Before custom interfaces in a COM server can be used at run-time by a
client across apartment, process, or machine boundaries, they must be
<i>marshaled</i>.  Method calls must be translated from the client's
address space to that of the server, and arguments must be packaged in the
client and converted in the server's environment. The return value from
the method call must also be packaged in the server and converted in the
client for use in the client's environment. A proxy on the client side
works with a stub on the server side to achieve this packaging and
unpackaging.

<P>
This sample builds a proxy/stub marshaling DLL to serve three interfaces
that will be used in subsequent samples in this series. The LOCCLIEN and
LOCSERVE samples will be the first that require this marshaling. The two
EXE applications built in those samples, LOCSERVE.EXE and LOCCLIEN.EXE,
are a client and out-of-process local server that manipulate the
car-related components introduced in earlier lessons. The MARSHAL.DLL
server built in this sample provies standard marshaling support for the
ICar, IUtility, and ICruise custom interfaces.

<P>
MARSHAL.DLL provides this support by implementing interface proxy and stub
functions for each method of each interface. The internal details of these
proxy/stub pairs, while worthy of study, are beyond the scope of this
lesson. Standard marshaling largely hides the details, so you can take a
black-box approach. For more information, see the COM documentation in the
Platform SDK.

<P>
MARSHAL.DLL registers itself as the provider of standard marshaling for
the interfaces specified in MICARS.IDL. Each interface is registered using
to the GUID specified for it (for example, IID_ICar for the ICar
interface). The makefile for MARSHAL invokes the REGISTER.EXE utility to
register the interfaces. Later, when a client calls COM to create an
instance of a component, the call specifies an execution context (for
example, CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER). This context indicates whether marshaling
is required for the interfaces on the created component, and if so,
whether the out-of-process server is on the local machine. COM thus loads
MARSHAL.DLL as needed, locating it by consulting the registry entries for
the marshaled interfaces.

<P>
The MARSHAL.DLL developed in this sample is very similar to the in-process
COM servers produced in previous samples. It is a COM server that offers
standard marshaling services for the interfaces it is registered to
handle. MARSHAL.DLL is produced by compiling some source files that are
automatically generated by the MIDL compiler when it compiles MICARS.IDL,
which specifies the custom interfaces.

<P>
The sequence of build operations in the makefile is different from that
seen in such previous COM server code samples, such as the DLLSERVE
in-process server. This is because most of the source code for MARSHAL.DLL
is automatically generated by the MIDL compiler. The dependencies in the
makefile guarantee that these generated source files (in this case,
MICARS.H, MICARS_I.C, MICARS_P.C, and DLLDATA.C) are created before any
attempt is made to compile and link them. Here is the MIDL compilation
from the makefile:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  # Generate the proxy/stub source from the .IDL file.
  micars.h micars_p.c micars_i.c dlldata.c: micars.idl
    midl /ms_ext /app_config /c_ext micars.idl
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The generated source files all depend on MICARS.IDL. If any of them are
absent, all will be regenerated by MIDL. If MICARS.IDL has a more recent
time stamp than the C files, all the files will be regenerated.

<P>
MICARS.IDL is thus the principal source for this entire executable. The
following are the interface definitions from MICARS.IDL:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  [uuid(0002da00-0000-0000-c000-000000000046),
      object
  ]
  interface ICar : IUnknown
  {
    import &quot;unknwn.idl&quot;;

    HRESULT Shift([in] short nGear);
    HRESULT Clutch([in] short nEngaged);
    HRESULT Speed([in] short nMph);
    HRESULT Steer([in] short nAngle);
  }

  [uuid(0002da01-0000-0000-c000-000000000046),
      object
  ]
  interface IUtility : IUnknown
  {
    import &quot;unknwn.idl&quot;;

    HRESULT Offroad([in] short nGear);
    HRESULT Winch([in] short nRpm);
  }

  [uuid(0002da02-0000-0000-c000-000000000046),
      object
  ]
  interface ICruise : IUnknown
  {
    import &quot;unknwn.idl&quot;;

    HRESULT Engage([in] BOOL bOnOff);
    HRESULT Adjust([in] BOOL bUpDown);
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
MIDL's specialized interface syntax is similar to that of C++. Because
each interface is derived from IUnknown, a common .IDL file specifying it
(UNKNWN.IDL, provided as part of the Platform SDK) is imported. The [in]
directional attributes direct how the method arguments are marshaled.
Other directional attributes in MIDL are [out] and [in,out]. Complete
details on MIDL are beyond the scope of this lesson's introduction to
standard marshaling. For more information on MIDL, see the Platform SDK.

<P>
Note that in previous code samples in this series, where marshaling was
not involved, car-related interfaces like ICar could have used the int
parameter type without problems. In this and the following lessons that
involve marshaling, these parameter types are short (as in the ICar Shift
method above). In the past this use of short paramters in marshaled
interfaces was necessary when compiling 16-bit applications. Consistent
with this, earlier versions of MIDL would generate compiler errors and not
produce marshaling support for parameter types such as int whose final
machine representation may be hardware-dependent. However, for Win32
applications, this restriction is no longer enforced by MIDL and the int
parameter type can be used in interfaces that require marshaling.

<P>
MICARS.H is generated by the MIDL compiler when it compiles MICARS.IDL.
(MICARS.H looks very similar to the ICARS.H interface declaration file
from previous samples in this series.) MICARS.H is used as an include file
when compiling the clients and servers that require the interface
marshaling it supports. For example, LOCCLIEN.CPP includes this file for
its declarations of the ICar, IUtility, and ICruise interfaces. Because
the later samples like LOCSERVE and LOCCLIEN rely on MARSHAL.DLL, the
MARSHAL makefile copies the generated MICARS.H file to the sibling \INC
directory.

<P>
The C files (MICARS_I.C, MICARS_P.C, and DLLDATA.C) created by the MIDL
compiler are later compiled and linked to produce MARSHAL.DLL. Here are
the rules for these compilations from the makefile.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  # Compilation/Dependency rules for the .DLL source files.
  #
  $(TDIR)\micars_i.obj: micars.h
    $(cc) $(cvarsdll) $(cflags) $(CDBG) -Fo$@ micars_i.c

  $(TDIR)\micars_p.obj: micars.h
    $(cc) $(cvarsdll) $(cflags) $(CDBG) -Fo$@ micars_p.c

  # Note the compiler switch that defines REGISTER_PROXY_DLL.
  # This turns on conditional compilaiton of default definitions for the
  # DllMain, DllRegisterServer, and DllUnregisterServer functions. This
  # means that these functions do not need to be explicitly defined
  # in a separate source module.
  $(TDIR)\dlldata.obj: micars.h
    $(cc) $(cvarsdll) $(cflags) $(CDBG) -DREGISTER_PROXY_DLL -Fo$@ dlldata.c
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The automatically generated C files are the only files that need be
compiled. DLLDATA.C has some special features that greatly ease the task
of producing the DLL. These special features are controlled in the
rpcproxy.h file that is included by DLLDATA.C in the the following
line:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  #include &lt;rpcproxy.h&gt;
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
RPCPROXY.H supports some important conditional compilation that is
controlled by defining the appropriate macros prior to compilation. The
most important of these is the REGISTER_PROXY_DLL macro. By defining this,
you can enable default definitions for the DllMain, DllRegisterServer, and
DllUnregisterServer functions. By relying on these default function
definitions you don't need to explicitly define them as you normally would
for an in-process COM server.

<P>
Since MICARS.IDL specified the interfaces completely, enough information
is available when DLLDATA.C is compiled to automatically generate the code
within DllRegisterServer and DllUnregisterServer to register and
unregister the interfaces. In contrast to the registration process in
previous server samples, it is interfaces, rather than components, that
are now being registered and unregistered. From the standpoint of this
sample, you can regard this process as a black box. By enabling the
default functions, MARSHAL.DLL will contain appropriate code to fully
register and unregister the interfaces. MARSHAL.DLL will also have a
default DllMain definition. For more details on writing explicit functions
for DllMain, DllRegisterServer, and DllUnregisterServer, see the MARSHAL2
sample.

<P>
Whether or not you define the REGISTER_PROXY_DLL macro, the MIDL-generated
C files will have default definitions for the other required functions:
DllGetClassObject, DllCanUnloadNow, and GetProxyDllInfo. The
GetProxyDllInfo function is used internally by COM. The DllGetClassObject
and DllCanUnloadNow functions should be familiar as standard fixtures for
COM in-process servers. Thus, MARSHAL.DLL is actually an in-process server
with a class factory as well as special COM components that support the
operation of standard marshaling for those interfaces originally specified
in MICARS.IDL. These default functions are defined for you but you must
still export them from the DLL during the final link of the object
modules. The following is the final link of MARSHAL.DLL from the makefile:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  # Link the object and resource binaries into the target DLL binary.
  # Build the import LIB file so apps can link to and use this DLL.
  $(DLL).dll: $(DLLOBJS)
      $(LINK)  @&lt;&lt;
      $(LINKFLAGS) $(dlllflags)
      -out:$@
      -base:0x1C000000
      -def:$*.def
      -implib:$*.lib
      -map:$(TDIR)\$*.map
      $(DLLOBJS)
      $(olelibsdll) $(APPLIBS)
  &lt;&lt;
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The Linker's -def:$*.def command line switch is used above. This reduces
to -def:MARSHAL.DEF when the makefile is processed. Thus, the link relies
on MARSHAL.DEF for the necessary export specifications. Here is
MARSHAL.DEF:

interface look like this.

     \CLSID
        \{0002DA00-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} = &quot;PSFactoryBuffer&quot;
           \InprocServer32 = &quot;D:\TUTSAMP\MARSHAL\MARSHAL.DLL&quot;
            ThreadingModel = &quot;Both&quot;

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
     \Interface
         \{0002DA00-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} = &quot;ICar&quot;
           \NumMethods = &quot;7&quot;
           \ProxyStubClsid32 = &quot;{0002DA00-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}&quot;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID, this marshaling DLL appears with the
in-process COM server entry, InprocServer32. COM treats this standard
marshaling server as an in-process server. Note that this server is
registered to support both the Apartment and Free threading models. For
more information on the significance of this designation see the FRESERVE
sample.

<P>
The default registration code uses the GUID of the first interface
encountered (for example, IID_ICar) as the CLSID for registering the
entire proxy/stub server. COM later uses this CLSID to locate and load
MARSHAL.DLL for the marshaling of any of the interfaces it is registered
to handle (that is, ICar, IUtility, ICruise). When an application makes an
interface method call that crosses apartment, process, or machine
boundaries, COM uses the interface's IID (that is, a GUID) registry entry
to locate the CLSID registry entry for the MARSHAL.DLL server. It then
uses this CLSID to load the server (if it isn't already loaded) so the
interface call can then be marshaled using the appropriate proxy/stub pair
in the server.

<P>
In the preceding registry entries the CLSID used for the server is the
GUID of the first interface encountered (in this case, IID_ICar). This
double use of the GUID is permitted because the interface IID will not be
confused with the server's CLSID--the same GUID can be safely used for
completely different things. The default behavior of using the IID of the
first interface encountered as the CLSID of the proxy/stub server is
adequate for most programming.

<P>
However, there are situations that may warrant explicit control over the
default DLLDATA.C code that is generated. For example, instead of relying
on the default use of the first interface IID as the marshaling server's
CLSID, you can explicitly specify a CLSID. When REGISTER_PROXY_DLL is
defined, RPCPROXY.H provides for additional conditional compilation
control with the following macros: PROXY_CLSID=&lt;clsid symbol&gt;,
PROXY_CLSID_IS=&lt;explicit value of guid&gt;, and
ENTRY_PREFIX=&lt;function name prefix&gt;.

<P>
The PROXY_CLSID= macro explicitly specifies a CLSID for the marshaling
server. The following is an example of how this macro is defined in a
linker command-line switch:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  -DREGISTER_PROXY_DLL -DPROXY_CLSID=CLSID_CarMarshal
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This macro directly uses the CLSID definition symbol that you may have
already defined elsewhere in an include file using the DEFINE_GUID macro.
It assumes that you have declared and instantiated CLSID_CarMarshal
elsewhere in this DLL. For more information, see the discussion of
INITGUID.H in DLLSERVE.HTM.

<P>
The PROXY_CLSID_IS macro can be used instead of PROXY_CLSID to define
the explicit value of the CLSID in the standard binary HEX form of a GUID.
The following example illustrates this:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  -DPROXY_CLSID_IS={0x0002da03,0x0000,0x0000,{0xc0,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x46}}
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The ENTRY_PREFIX macro is used to generate the marshaling server code in a
way that combines the proxies with other COM objects in the same
in-process server. In many cases the interfaces that are marshaled in the
marshaling server are implemented in COM objects that are housed in
different servers. A separate marshaling server is appropriate for these
situations. However, there are cases when the interfaces exposed by the
COM objects are uniquely associated with those objects. In these
situations it can be efficient to combine the marshaling server with the
in-process server that houses the application COM objects. Thus, a COM
server--such as the previous DLLSERVE sample server--that would normally
house application COM objects can also be used as the server housing for
the marshaling proxy. The ENTRY_PREFIX provides a convenient way to create
this combined server.

<P>
By specifying the ENTRY_PREFIX macro, each of the normal DLL entry points
supplied in DLLDATA.C (via RPCPROXY.H) is renamed by adding the specified
entry prefix. Thus, the DllGetClassObject generated for the proxy becomes
&lt;prefix&gt;DllGetClassObject, and so on. The enveloping COM server would
implement and expose the normal DllGetClassObject function. The main
functions should call their renamed counterpart functions (that is,
&lt;prefix&gt;DllMain, &lt;prefix&gt;DllGetClassObject,
&lt;prefix&gt;DllCanUnloadNow, &lt;prefix&gt;DllRegisterServer, and
&lt;prefix&gt;DllUnregisterServer) at the end of the server's main
implementation of these functions.

<P>
For example, if ENTRY_PREFIX=Prxy during the compile of DLLDATA.C, then
the server's main implementation of DllGetClassObject would look like
the following (based on code in DLLSERVE.CPP):

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDAPI DllGetClassObject(
           REFCLSID rclsid,
           REFIID riid,
           PPVOID ppv)
  {
    HRESULT hr = CLASS_E_CLASSNOTAVAILABLE;
    IUnknown* pCob = NULL;
    BOOL bProxyObject = TRUE;

    if (CLSID_DllCar == rclsid)
    {
      hr = E_OUTOFMEMORY;
      pCob = new CFCar(NULL, g_pServer);
      bProxyObject = FALSE;
    }
    else if (CLSID_DllUtilityCar == rclsid)
    {
      hr = E_OUTOFMEMORY;
      pCob = new CFUtilityCar(NULL, g_pServer);
      bProxyObject = FALSE;
    }

    if (NULL != pCob)
    {
      g_pServer-&gt;ObjectsUp();
      hr = pCob-&gt;QueryInterface(riid, ppv);
      if (FAILED(hr))
      {
        g_pServer-&gt;ObjectsDown();
        DELETE_POINTER(pCob);
      }
    }

    if (bProxyObject)
      hr = PrxyDllGetClassObject(rclsid, riid, ppv);

    return hr;
  }
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
You do not need to code any explicit linkage of the proxy object lifetimes
to the combined server lifetime. The proxy objects will maintain an
independent object count. Either object count will cause the DLL to stay
loaded. When the server's object count reaches zero, DllCanUnloadNow
should chain to PrxyDllCanUnloadNow in a manner similar to that shown
above for DllGetClassObject.

<P>
There are other special macros supported in RPCPROXY.H. See the comments
at the front of that file for more details. RPCPROXY.H is located in the
\MSSDK\INCLUDE directory of the installed Microsoft Platform SDK.
