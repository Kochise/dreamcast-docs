<h2><a name="APTCLIEN">APTCLIEN - Client of Multiple Apartment Server</a></h2>

<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
The APTCLIEN sample shows a client of several single-threaded apartments
in the APTSERVE server. APTCLIEN's main purpose is to exercise and reveal
for study the multiple apartments in the APTSERVE local out-of-process
server. The following REMCLIEN sample, run in conjunction with APTCLIEN,
shows the effects of multiple clients on the APTSERVE multithreaded
server, with one client controlling from a remote machine.

<P>
The COM objects that APTCLIEN manipulates are the car-related ones from
previous samples in this tutorial series, with the following interfaces:
ICar, IUtility, and ICruise. APTCLIEN works in conjunction with the
separate APTSERVE.EXE, which provides the COCar, COUtilityCar, and
COCruiseCar COM objects.

<P>
APTCLIEN.EXE creates its own COUtilityCruiseCar COM object by reusing the
COCruiseCar COM object by containment and augmenting it with a native
implementation of the IUtility interface. Like LOCCLIEN, APTCLIEN's
COUtilityCruiseCar composite object reuses COCruiseCar by containment.
However, because COCruiseCar and COCar are in different apartments,
COCruiseCar reuses COCar by containment rather than the aggregation shown
in previous lessons.

<P>
The composition of COUtilityCruiseCar is also interesting because the
COUtilityCruiseCar object's containment of the COCruiseCar object crosses
the process boundary between APTCLIEN and the out-of-process local server
APTSERVE.EXE. In addition, COCruiseCar's containment of COCar crosses
thread boundaries within APTSERVE. APTCLIEN uses standard marshaling
support for the custom interfaces it uses on the COCruiseCar and COCar
objects. This marshaling support is provided by the previous MARSHAL code
sample, so you must build the MARSHAL code sample prior to building and
running APTCLIEN and APTSERVE.

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of APTCLIEN, see the
Code Tour section in APTCLIEN.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of APTCLIEN, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
APTCLIEN.HTM. To read APTCLIEN.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the APTCLIEN lesson in the table of lessons. You can
also achieve the same thing by clicking the APTCLIEN.HTM file after
locating the main tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also
APTSERVE.HTM in the main directory for more details on how APTSERVE works
and exposes its services to APTCLIEN. You must build APTSERVE.EXE before
building APTCLIEN. The makefile for APTSERVE automatically registers that
server in the registry, so you must build APTSERVE before attempting to
run APTCLIEN.

<P>
For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

<h4>Usage</h4>

<P>
APTCLIEN is an application that you can execute directly from Windows in
the normal manner or from the Command Prompt window. No command line
parameters are recognized by APTCLIEN.

<h4>Run the Sample</h4>

<p>
The client sample and other related samples must be compiled before
you can run the client. For more details on building the samples, see
<a href="using.htm#building">
Building the Code Samples.</a>

<P>
If you have already built the appropriate samples, APTCLIEN.EXE is the
client executable to run for this sample.

<a href="APTCLIEN\APTCLIEN.exe">
Click here to run APTCLIEN.EXE.</a>

<P>
Depending on the security level of your browser you may see a dialog
allowing you to either open the .EXE file or save it to disk. Click the
"Open it" choice and then click the OK button.

<p>&#160;
<h3>OPERATION</h3>

<P>
The APTCLIEN.EXE application provides the user interface for this lesson.
It exercises the associated, but independent, APTSERVE.EXE out-of-process
local server. Here is a summary of operation from the standpoint of
APTCLIEN.EXE as a COM client of the APTSERVE.EXE COM server.

<P>
The APTCLIEN and APTSERVE samples are directly analogous to the LOCCLIEN
and LOCSERVE samples. The same components are used, and the same menu
system exercises those objects.

<P>
As in the LOCCLIEN code sample, support is provided for a trace logging
facility that will display in the APTCLIEN client application an
integrated trace log of activity in both client and server.

<P>
Although APTCLIEN functions much like the prior LOCCLIEN sample, here is a
short review for those readers who are visiting this code sample out of
sequence. The COM objects that are used in the APTCLIEN and APTSERVE code
samples represent sport utility vehicles. We invent some basic feature
sets for modeling such car objects. These feature sets are implemented as
interfaces to COM objects. The ICar interface provides some basic car
behavior: Shift, Clutch, Speed, and Steer. The IUtility interface provides
off-road utility systems: Offroad and Winch. The ICruise interface
provides automatic cruise control facilities: Engage and Adjust.

<P>
APTCLIEN.EXE provides menus for creating, releasing, and invoking methods
for four COM objects: COCar, COUtilityCar, COCruiseCar, and
COUtilityCruiseCar. These objects have combinations of the ICar, IUtility,
and ICruise interfaces. COCar objects expose the ICar interface.
COUtilityCar objects expose the ICar and IUtility interfaces. COCruiseCar
objects expose the ICar and ICruise interfaces. COUtilityCruiseCar objects
expose the ICar, ICruise, and IUtility interfaces. As a result, COCar
objects have only the basic car behavior (ICar). COUtilityCar objects have
basic car behavior (ICar) with sport utility systems (IUtility).
COCruiseCar objects have basic car behavior (ICar) with an automatic
cruise control system (ICruise). COUtilityCruiseCar objects have basic car
behavior (ICar), a cruise control system (ICruise), and a sport utility
system (IUtility).

<P>
COCar is constructed as an aggregatable COM object with a native
implementation of the ICar interface. COUtilityCar is constructed using
containment and is implemented in APTSERVE.EXE. For details, see the
APTSERVE lesson. COCruiseCar is also constructed using containment and is
also implemented in APTSERVE.EXE. COUtilityCruiseCar is constructed using
containment and is implemented in APTCLIEN.EXE. In this sample,
COUtilityCruiseCar reuses COCruiseCar by containment, which in turn reuses
COCar by containment to illustrate three levels of nested object reuse by
containment.

<P>
APTCLIEN.EXE presents a menu for each of these four main COM objects. Each
menu has commands that call the methods of the various available
interfaces. The code samples (both APTCLIEN and APTSERVE) issue trace
message log statements throughout. When you exercise the objects from
APTCLIEN.EXE, the main APTCLIEN window will display a log of internal
activity in these COM objects.

<P>
Like all code samples in the series, APTCLIEN uses many of the utility
classes and services provided by APPUTIL. For more details on APPUTIL,
study the APPUTIL library source code in the sibling APPUTIL directory and
APPUTIL.HTM in the main tutorial directory.

<P>
In addition to covering the coding techniques used, this lesson examines
the internal behavior of the APTCLIEN and APTSERVE client/server pair. As
a client, APTCLIEN offers nothing beyond what was shown in LOCCLIEN. The
significant difference is simply the use of different CLSIDs
(CLSID_AptCar, CLSID_AptUtilityCar, and CLSID_AptCruiseCar) for the
creation of the APTSERVE objects to be controlled.

<P>
We will tour internal behavior in both APTCLIEN and APTSERVE by looking at
some representative trace logs. Trace lines that begin with &quot;C:&quot;
mark behavior reported in the APTCLIEN.EXE client. Lines that begin with
&quot;L:&quot; mark behavior reported in the APTSERVE.EXE local
out-of-process server. The internal APTSERVE trace lines will also show
the thread ID of the executing thread in angle brackets after the
&quot;L&quot;. Since the client is single-threaded, its thread ID is not
shown. These trace logs were obtained under the Windows 95 operating
system. Because a multithreaded program is being traced, your results may
be slightly different if you replicate this logged behavior on you own
machine. For example, the server's AptThreadProc function will execute at
different times depending on the operating system's task load and
scheduling priorities.

<P>
After running APTCLIEN, choose the Create command from the Car menu. Here
is the resulting trace log.

This log shows that the following threads are started.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  &lt;FFFE7005&gt; - Main thread for the APTSERVE local server application.
  &lt;FFFEE289&gt; - AptCar component apartment thread.
  &lt;FFFEE4B1&gt; - AptUtilityCar component apartment thread.
  &lt;FFFEE811&gt; - AptCruiseCar component apartment thread.
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
We will abbreviate these to &lt;05&gt;, &lt;89&gt;, &lt;B1&gt;, and
&lt;11&gt;. The main thread, &lt;05&gt;, is also called the main apartment
thread and could be exploited more fully as an apartment in the strict
sense. But it is not exploited as such in this code sample. All four of
these threads are separate single-threaded apartments.

<p>
The main thread, &lt;05&gt;, executes the OpenFactories method. We see the
use of the CThreaded ownership mechanism, with the main thread requesting
and getting ownership of CServer. On this main thread we see the
constructors for each class factory. The class factories create the
threads for the AptCar, AptUtilityCar, and AptCruiseCar objects. At some
variable length of time after the thread creation calls, the operating
system calls each thread's AptThreadProc function to start the thread. We
see these calls reported as the threads for AptCar (&lt;89&gt;),
AptUtilityCar (&lt;B1&gt;), and AptCruiseCar (&lt;11&gt;) are started.
Within AptThreadProc, each thread also registers the apartment's new class
factory with COM. The main thread, &lt;05&gt;, relinquishes ownership of
CServer, and the log then reports that OpenFactories has ended.

<p>
We then see the CFCar class factory used to create the requested new COCar
object. CFCar and the constructor of the new COCar object both execute on
the AptCar thread, &lt;89&gt;. When the class factory is successful in
creating the COCar object, we see the server's object count incremented to
1 inside the protection of the OwnThis ownership by thread &lt;89&gt;. We
then see the delegated release of the IClassFactory held by the client.
COM still holds three outstanding references to the registered CFCar class
factory and two outstanding references to the COCar object.

<p>
Next choose the ICar::Shift command from the Car menu to see the client
call the interface methods of the new COCar object.

<p>
In the process of obtaining the interface pointer, ICar's own AddRef and
Release functions are called. Before this Shift call, COCar had two
outstanding references. Afterwards, it ended with three references prior
to the actual call to pICar-&gt;Shift. The Shift method call indicates
this is the first call to this object instance's ICar interface.

We see COM efficiency at work if we choose the ICar::Shift command from
the Car menu again.

COM had cached the interface information during the previous ICar::Shift
call, so that on this second call the interface pointer was returned
directly without QueryInterface calls to the COCar object. The actual
Shift call is executed on thread &lt;89&gt;. This call was marshaled from
the client process to this server's AptCar thread, &lt;89&gt;. The ICar

<p>
COUtilityCruiseCar is a composite COM object created in the client. It
reuses the COCruiseCar COM object provided by the server. COCruiseCar in
turn reuses the COCar COM object provided by the server. In the server, we
see the CruiseCar class factory executing on the AptCruiseCar thread,
&lt;11&gt;, to create a new COCruiseCar whose constructor also runs on
this thread. The server object count is incremented to 2 by this thread
when it obtains ownership of CServer. The object count is now 2, one for
the original COCar created at the start of this lesson and one for the new
COCruiseCar.

<p>
To complete the creation of COCruiseCar its Init method is called on the
AptCruiseCar thread, &lt;11&gt;. We see the resulting CFCar class factory
executed on the AptCar thread, &lt;89&gt;. The creation of this new COCar
object is completed on this thread, and it increments the server's object
count to 3. Through the remainder of the log, the behavior winds back out
of the object creations with COM, causing various QueryInterface, AddRef,
and Release calls. Upon completion, there are three outstanding references
on CFCar, three on the new COCar object, three on CFCruiseCar, and four on
the new COCruiseCar object. Most of these outstanding references to our
custom interfaces are held within COM.

<p>
Now choose the ICar::Shift command from the UtilityCruiseCar menu.

<p>
The interface obtained is on the composite COUtilityCruiseCar object that
is created within the client. Using this interface, the Shift call is
delegated to the contained COCruiseCar object. At this point COM has to
marshal the call from the APTCLIEN client process to thread &lt;11&gt;,
where the COCruiseCar object resides. COCruiseCar is a composite object
and delegates the ICar::Shift call to its contained COCar object. COM now
has to marshal the call again within the server from the COCruiseCar
apartment thread, &lt;11&gt;, to the COCar thread, &lt;89&gt;. On this
AptCar thread, &lt;89&gt;, we see the Shift action finally performed.

<p>
For this call to ICar::Shift on the COUtilityCruiseCar object, COM
enforces the apartment model and ensures that, regardless of the calling
thread, the call performed in the particular object is executed on the
thread of that object. The ICar interface call counter shows 1, indicating
a first call to this interface on the new contained COCar object. This
count confirms that this is a new instance of COCar. If the COCar
originally created at the start of this lesson had been somehow mistakenly
used, we would see an interface call count of 3 because of the two Shift
calls to that COCar object earlier in this lesson.

<p>
This event causes the COUtilityCruiseCar destructor to run. It releases
the IUnknown of the contained COCruiseCar object. In the server, we see
the resulting releases of interfaces on COCruiseCar held by the client and
by COM. These releases run on the AptCruiseCar thread, &lt;11&gt;, and
decrement the COCruiseCar reference count to 0, forcing the destruction of
the COCruiseCar object. Thread &lt;11&gt; gains ownership of CServer and
decrements the server's object count to 2. The COCruiseCar destruction
causes this object to release its hold on its contained COCar. We see the
resulting releases of the interfaces on COCar held by COCruiseCar and by
COM. These run on the AptCar thread, &lt;89&gt;, and decrement of the
COCar reference count to 0, which forces the destruction of the COCar
object. The AptCar thread, &lt;89&gt;, gains ownership of CServer and
decrements the server's object count to 1. Finally, we see the destructors
for all the various interface implementation C++ objects.

<p>
The resulting object count of 1 reflects the remaining existence of the
original COCar object created at the start of this lesson. We will now
release this only remaining object supplied by APTSERVE and watch the
server shutdown. From the Car menu, choose Release.

<p>
The client releases the IUnknown of the COCar object. In the server, we
see a resulting cascade of releases of COCar interfaces held by the client
and by COM. These are executed on the AptCar thread, &lt;89&gt;, and
decrement the COCar reference count to 0, which forces the destruction of
the COCar object. Thread &lt;89&gt; gains ownership of CServer and
decrements the server's object count to 0, triggering a shutdown of the
entire server. This happens in the ObjectsDown method, where a WM_CLOSE
message is sent to the main thread, &lt;05&gt;, of the server process.
This message causes an exit of the server application's message loop. The
server's CServer::CloseFactories method is then called.

<p>
Within CloseFactories, we see the unregistering of the class factories
with COM and the termination of the AptCar, AptUtilityCar, and
AptCruiseCar threads. The apartment thread message loops are exited after
WM_QUIT messages are sent to each apartment thread from CloseFactories,
which is running on the main thread, &lt;05&gt;. Before CloseFactories
returns, we see the releases of the interfaces held on the class
factories. These releases decrement each factory's reference count to 0
and cause the destructors to run for the CFCar, CFUtilityCar, and
CFCruiseCar objects. After CloseFactories, execution exits the main
application, and the operating system unloads APTSERVE.
