<P>The <I>Filter Graph Editor</I> provided with the Microsoft DirectShow&#153; Software Development Kit (SDK) is a graphical tool that creates and manages filter graphs. There are three types of filters: source filters, transform filters, and renderer filters. The Filter Graph Editor is a graphic user interface you use to construct filter graphs by inserting filters and creating connections between them. For example, you can render the filter graph for a specific multimedia source file, such as Dolphin.mov, and see each of the connections in the graph, as in the following example. 

<P><IMG SRC="art/vbbld01.gif" WIDTH="636" HEIGHT="308" ALT="Filter Graph Editor example" > 
 
<P>The same filter graph objects, filters and pins, can be managed from a 
sample Visual Basic-based application that uses Quartz.dll. For simplicity, the 
Visual Basic-based application uses list boxes rather than graphical elements to 
show the parts of the filter graph, and displays information for only one 
filter and only one pin at a time. (The purpose of the application is not to 
compete with the Filter Graph Editor, but to demonstrate how to retrieve and 
manage the same underlying filter graph information using Visual Basic.) 
 
<P>The following illustration shows the same multimedia source file, 
Dolphin.mov, as depicted by the Visual Basic-based sample application. 
 
<P><IMG SRC="art/vbbld02.gif" WIDTH="490" HEIGHT="450" ALT="VB Builder sample" > 
 
<P>The list box labeled "Filters in current filter graph" lists the four 
filters required for this source file. The list box labeled "Pins in selected 
filter" lists the two pins defined for the selected Indeo Video R4.1 Decompression Filter: the 
"XForm In" and "XForm Out" pins. The XForm In pin is selected, so the 
application displays detailed information about this pin, including its 
direction and connection information. 
 
<P>The remainder of this article discusses the Visual Basic code you can 
use to retrieve and manage such filter graph information. In addition to the 
general-purpose code that works with any source input, the application 
includes a routine that illustrates a more likely use of these properties and 
methods&#151;building a specific hard-coded filter graph for your Visual Basic-based 
application. 
 
<P>This article assumes you have already set up your Visual Basic 
environment to use Quartz.dll. For more 
information about setting up your Visual Basic environment, see 
<A HREF="dssd0040.htm" TARGET="TEXT">Controlling Filter Graphs Using Visual Basic</A>. 

<A NAME="vbbld_0001030109020000"></A><P><B>About the DirectShow Quartz.dll Objects</B>
<P>Quartz.dll provides objects that you can use in your Visual 
Basic-based applications to manage filters and pins. There is an implicit hierarchy 
among these objects; that is, you must often access the properties of one object to 
obtain another object. In the following example, an object that appears 
indented below another indicates that you obtain that lower-level object from 
a property or method of the higher-level object.
 
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2"> 
Filter graph object (IMediaControl) 
  Filter collection (RegFilterCollection, FilterCollection properties) 
    Filter Info object (IFilterInfo or IRegFilterInfo in filter collection) 
      Pin collection (Pins property) 
        Pin Info object (IPinInfo item in pins collection) 
</FONT></PRE>
<P>The top-level object in the hierarchy is the filter graph object, or the 
<A HREF="dssd0023.htm" TARGET="TEXT">IMediaControl</A> object,
which represents the entire filter graph. You can access
two properties of the
<B>IMediaControl</B> object
to obtain collections of filter
objects. The <A HREF="dssd0023.htm#vbref_0001020205020400" TARGET="TEXT">RegFilterCollection</A>
property represents the filters registered
with the system. The <A HREF="dssd0023.htm#vbref_0001020205020200" TARGET="TEXT">FilterCollection</A>
property represents the filters that are
part of the filter graph. 

<P>As with other collections accessible to Visual Basic, you can access 
individual items in the collections by using the Visual Basic <B>for 
each...next</B> statement. The number of items in the collection is indicated by 
the <A HREF="dssd0019.htm#vbref_0001020201020100" TARGET="TEXT">Count</A> property of the collection. 
 
<P>The filter collection contains <A HREF="dssd0022.htm" TARGET="TEXT">IFilterInfo</A>
objects. Each <B>IFilterInfo</B> object
has a <A HREF="dssd0022.htm#vbref_0001020204020600" TARGET="TEXT">Pins</A> property that represents
a collection of pins defined for that filter.
 
<P>The pins collection contains <A HREF="dssd0027.htm" TARGET="TEXT">IPinInfo</A> objects.
Each <B>IPinInfo</B> object
includes detailed information about that pin, including its media type and its 
connection to another pin. 
 
<P>To examine a specific pin on a filter in the filter graph, use the 
following procedure. 
 
<OL><LI>Obtain the filter graph object. 
<LI>Use the <A HREF="dssd0023.htm#vbref_0001020205020200" TARGET="TEXT">IMediaControl.FilterCollection</A> 
property of the filter graph object to obtain the
collection of filters present in the filter graph. 
<LI>Search through the filter collection for the specific filter. 
<LI>Use the <A HREF="dssd0022.htm#vbref_0001020204020600" TARGET="TEXT">IFilterInfo.Pins</A> property of the filter object to

</OL>
<A NAME="vbbld_0001030109030000"></A><P><B>Creating a Filter Graph</B>
<P>There are three distinct ways to use Quartz.dll to create a filter graph; 
each way offers a different amount of control over the filter graph. These range 
from automatically generating the entire filter graph to specifying every 
filter and pin connection. The three approaches are as follows: 
 
<UL><LI>Automatic. 
<P>Generate the complete filter graph from either a multimedia source or a stored filter graph file. 
<LI>Semi-automatic.
<P>Create a new (empty) filter graph, add one or more filters, then automatically generate all filters and connections needed to 
render a specific pin. 
<LI>Manual. 
<P>Create a new (empty) filter graph, add individual filters to the graph, and explicitly add connections between pins. 
</UL>
<P>The sample application, Builder, demonstrates all three approaches. 
The application's "Generate from input file" command on the 
FilterGraph menu supports the first 
approach. The New command (empty) on the FilterGraph menu supports the other two 
approaches. 

<A NAME="vbbld_0001030109040000"></A><P><B>Generating the Complete Filter Graph</B>
<P>The following code fragment demonstrates how to generate the complete 
filter graph based on the multimedia source or stored filter graph. After 
creating an <A HREF="dssd0023.htm" TARGET="TEXT">IMediaControl</A> object that is
initially "empty," the application calls the 
<A HREF="dssd0023.htm#vbref_0001020205020600" TARGET="TEXT">IMediaControl.RenderFile</A> method to 
build up the complete graph:
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">' fragment from the Filter Graph menu's Generate from input file command 
    ' start by creating a new, empty filter graph;

    ' ... 
    ' Use the common File Open dialog to let the user select the input file 
    CommonDialog1.ShowOpen  ' user selects a source or filter graph 
    ' call IMediaControl.RenderFile to add all filters and connect all pins
    g_objMC.RenderFile CommonDialog1.filename  ' generates the complete graph 
</FONT></PRE>
<A NAME="vbbld_0001030109050000"></A><P><B>Creating a New Filter Graph and Adding Filters</B>
<P>The following code fragment demonstrates how to create the new (empty) filter graph object. 
 
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">' fragment from the Filter Graph menu's New (empty) command handler 
    Dim g_objMC as IMediaControl  ' from the General Declarations section 
    ... 
    Set g_objMC = New FilgraphManager  ' create the new filter graph 
</FONT></PRE>
<P>When you choose to create an empty filter graph and add individual filters, 
you must know the filter type. In general, there are three categories of 
filters: source filters, transform filters, and renderer filters. The procedure 
for adding source filters uses a different method than the procedure for 
adding transform and renderer filters. 
 
<P>Add source filters to the filter graph by calling the
<A HREF="dssd0023.htm#vbref_0001020205020100" TARGET="TEXT">IMediaControl.AddSourceFilter</A> method 
and supplying the name of a file of the specified
source type or stored filter graph. 
 
<P>The main form of the application includes a button labeled "Add Source 
Filter..." that uses the common File Open dialog box to query the user for the 
name of the source file or stored filter graph. The application supplies the 
specified file as the parameter to <A HREF="dssd0023.htm#vbref_0001020205020100" TARGET="TEXT">AddSourceFilter</A>.

property, which represents the
collection of filter objects registered with the system and available for use.

<P>In the sample program, the list box labeled "Registered filters" contains 
the names of all the filters that appear in the
<A HREF="dssd0023.htm#vbref_0001020205020400" TARGET="TEXT">RegFilterCollection</A> property. The following

<A NAME="vbbld_0001030109060000"></A><P><B>Connecting Filter Pins</B>
<P>After adding individual filters to the filter graph, you can establish 
connections between the filters by explicitly connecting each pin, or by 
automatically generating all connections that are needed downstream from a specific 
pin. 
 
<P>In both cases, you must traverse the hierarchy of DirectShow 
objects to obtain the
<A HREF="dssd0027.htm" TARGET="TEXT">IPinInfo</A> object that represents a pin of the filter
object. This involves finding the desired filter in the filter collection of the filter graph object,
then finding the desired pin in the pin collection of the filter object.

<P>The sample application featured in this article is similar to the filter 
graph editor utility, allowing a user to create and manage any filter graph. 
Most applications will not provide such a general-purpose interface&#151;they are 
more likely to create only the specific filter graphs needed by the 
application. 
 
<P>The sample application provides one subroutine that creates such a custom 
filter graph. The Options menu offers a "Build custom graph" command that 
calls this subroutine. 
 
<P>The routine that handles this command creates five filter objects and eight 
pin objects. The routine then connects pins by calling the
<A HREF="dssd0027.htm#vbref_0001020209020100" TARGET="TEXT">IPinInfo.Connect</A>
method. 
 
<P>The graph connects the following filters: AVI Source, AVI Decompressor, 
AVI Splitter, Video Renderer, and Audio Renderer. 
These filters can be connected 
by reusing just two pin object variables. For clarity, however, each pin 
object is defined using a name that indicates its position in the filter 
graph. 
 
<P>The filters and pins are declared as follows:

<P>The application adds the source filter object by calling the 
<A HREF="dssd0023.htm#vbref_0001020205020100" TARGET="TEXT">IMediaControl.AddSourceFilter</A>
method:
 
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">' create the source filter using IMediaControl.AddSourceFilter
    CommonDialog1.ShowOpen  ' get the name of the source AVI file 
    g_objMC.AddSourceFilter CommonDialog1.filename, pSourceFilter 
</FONT></PRE>
<P>The application adds the other filter objects by searching for a 
specific name in the registered filter collection 
(the filter collection is available from the
<A HREF="dssd0023.htm#vbref_0001020205020400" TARGET="TEXT">IMediaControl.RegFilterCollection</A>
property), and calling the
<A HREF="dssd0028.htm#vbref_000102020a020100" TARGET="TEXT">IRegFilterInfo.Filter</A>
method when it finds the specific filter to add:
 
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">' add all non-source filters from the collection of registered filters 
    Set g_objRegFilters = g_objMC.RegFilterCollection 
' use the local subroutine AddFilter to find the filter named 
' "AVI Decompressor" in the collection, and set the variable pDECFilter 
    AddFilter "AVI Decompressor", pDECFilter  
</FONT></PRE>
<P>The AddFilter subroutine of the application loops through all the filters 
present in the collection. When the names match, it calls the
<A HREF="dssd0028.htm#vbref_000102020a020100" TARGET="TEXT">IRegFilterInfo.Filter</A> method
to add the filter to the filter graph:
 
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">Private Sub AddFilter(FName As String, f As IFilterInfo) 
' call IRegFilterInfo.Filter
 
    Set LocalRegFilters = g_objMC.RegFilterCollection 
    Dim filter As IRegFilterInfo 
    For Each filter In LocalRegFilters 
        If filter.Name = FName Then 
            filter.filter f 
            Exit For 
        End If 
    Next filter 
</FONT></PRE>
<P>The application calls similar code for the AVI Compressor, AVI Splitter, 
Video Renderer, and Audio Renderer filters. 
After obtaining all the filter objects, the application uses the
<A HREF="dssd0022.htm#vbref_0001020204020600" TARGET="TEXT">IFilterInfo.Pins</A> property
to find specific pin objects. The code loops through
all pin objects in the collection, searching for the specific pin names and 
setting the individual pin objects when they are found, as shown in the following code fragment.
 
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2">' Get the source filter pin we need to build the graph 
For Each pPin In pSourceFilter.Pins
      Debug.Print pPin.Name
      If pPin.Name = "Output" Then

      End If
    Next pPin

    AddFilter "AVI Decompressor", pDECFilter
    'Print out list of pins on decompressor filter
    For Each pPin In pDECFilter.Pins
      Debug.Print pPin.Name
      ' save specific pins to connect them
      If pPin.Name = "XForm In" Then
          Set DECInPin = pPin
      End If
      If pPin.Name = "XForm Out" Then
          Set DECOutPin = pPin
      End If
    Next pPin

'Add AVI Splitter
    AddFilter "AVI Splitter", pAVISplitter
    'Print out list of pins on decompressor filter
    For Each pPin In pAVISplitter.Pins
      Debug.Print pPin.Name
      ' save specific pins to connect them
      ' pin 0, pin 1
      If pPin.Name = "input pin" Then
          Set SplitterInPin = pPin
      ElseIf pPin.Name = "Stream 00" Then
          Set SplitterOut00Pin = pPin
      ElseIf pPin.Name = "Stream 01" Then
          Set SplitterOut01Pin = pPin
      End If
    Next pPin
    
</FONT></PRE>
<P>After initializing the eight pin objects, it is a simple matter to call the 
<A HREF="dssd0027.htm#vbref_0001020209020100" TARGET="TEXT">IPinInfo.Connect</A> method to establish
the four connections between them.
The following code fragment demonstrates the connection calls. 
 
<PRE><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="2"> 
' connect the pins 
' Note:  error handling omitted for brevity 
'Connect Source video output pin to AVI splitter input pin
    SourceOutputPin.Connect SplitterInPin
' Connect AVI splitter stream 00 to AVI decompressor
    SplitterOut00Pin.Connect DECInPin
' Connect AVI splitter stream 01 to audio renderer
    SplitterOut01Pin.Connect AudioRendInPin
 'Connect AVI decompressor output pin to Video renderer input pin
    DECOutPin.Connect VidRendInPin
</FONT></PRE>
<P>You can establish the connection from either pin; after 
a successful call to the <A HREF="dssd0027.htm#vbref_0001020209020100" TARGET="TEXT">Connect</A> method,
you can access the connection
information from either pin object.
