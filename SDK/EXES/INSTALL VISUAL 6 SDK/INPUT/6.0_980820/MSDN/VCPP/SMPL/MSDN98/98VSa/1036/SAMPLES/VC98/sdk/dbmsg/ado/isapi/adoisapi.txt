ADOISAPI Sample
===============
This is a C/C++ ISAPI extension sample that works with Microsoft Internet Information Server. This sample establishes a connection to a database, fetches data, formats the data as an HTML table and returns the data back to the client's browser. The connection to the database in this sample is cached for better performance.

Setup
-----
1. Copy adoisapi.dll to some directory on the web server with execute access with /scripts as the directory's alias.
2. Copy adoisapi.htm to some directory on the web server with read access.
3. Make sure OLE_DB_NWind_Jet has been set up as an ODBC system DSN on the web server machine. To verify this, bring up ODBC Administrator from the control panel, select the System DSN tab and make sure that OLE_DB_NWind_Jet is listed as a system data source. If not, you need to create a System DSN called OLE_DB_NWind_Jet and point it to the OLE DB SDK sample database.
