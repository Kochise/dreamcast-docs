<h2><a name="PERTEXT">
PERTEXT - IPersistStreamInit Persistent Object Server</a></h2>

<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
PERTEXT is the second sample in a group of samples that covers various
techniques for implementing COM object persistence. The first sample,
PERSERVE, covers persistence by implementing the IPersistStream standard
interface. This sample, PERTEXT, covers persistence by implementing the
IPersistStreamInit standard interface. The third sample, PERDRAW, covers
persistence by implementing the IPersistStorage standard interface. The
fourth sample, PERCLIEN, covers how a client exploits the kinds of
persistence provided the PERSERVE, PERTEXT, and PERDRAW server components.

<P>
The PERTEXT sample introduces the COTextPage COM object, which
encapsulates the data of an editable page of text. COTextPage objects
expose a set of interfaces whose methods make the objects connectable,
persistent managers of text data. Client access to this data is available
through an ITextPage custom interface. COTextPage implements the ITextPage
interface.

<P>
The PERTEXT sample keeps a clear architectural distinction between client
and server. Among other things, COTextPage provides no graphical user
interface (GUI), relying instead upon the client for all GUI behavior.

<P>
The PERCLIEN client provides the GUI display and manages the list of
pages, the contents of which are stored in a compound file that contains
both the contents of the list and of each page in that list. The user of
PERCLIEN can edit the content of two types of pages: text pages and
drawing pages. Text pages have data that the user can edit using a simple
windowed text editor. Drawing pages have drawing data that the user can
edit using free-form, scribble-like functionality based on the earlier
STOSERVE and STOCLIEN samples. Both types of editing are done in separate
client windows. For more information, see PERCLIEN.HTM.

<P>
Storage in the compound file is achieved because the components provide
persistent COM objects that encapsulate the page list and edited page
data. PERSERVE houses a persistent object that encapsulates the single
page list kept in each compound file containing such pages. PERTEXT houses
a persistent object that encapsulates the edited text data for each text
page. PERDRAW houses a persistent object that encapsulates the drawing
data for each drawing page.

<P>
The COPageList object in the PERSERVE sample encapsulates the persistent
page list data. COPageList implements the IPersistStream standard
interface to expose control of the page list storage located in the
client-provided stream of a compound file. The COTextPage object in this
PERTEXT sample encapsulates the data of an edited text page. COTextPage
implements the IPersistStreamInit standard interface to expose control of
the text data storage that is located in the client-provided stream of a
compound file. In contrast to these stream-based persistent objects, the
CODrawPage object in the PERDRAW sample encapsulates the persistent
drawing-ink data. CODrawPage implements the IPersistStorage standard
interface to expose control of the drawing-ink data storage located in the
client-provided substorage of a compound file.

<P>
This code sample focuses primarily on COTextPage's implementation of the
IPersistStreamInit interface to provide stream-based persistence for a COM
object. IPersistStreamInit's InitNew method is the main difference between
the IPersistStream interface used in the PERSERVE sample and the
IPersistStreamInit interface used in the PERTEXT sample. This sample
covers the InitNew method in detail. PERTEXT works with the PERCLIEN code
sample to illustrate the joint use by client and server of
IPersistStreamInit-based persistence.

<P>
COTextPage's support for object persistence is the primary means of
storing the text page data. COTextPage stores its text data in a
client-provided stream located in a structured storage compound file. The
compound file has a unique format because of the various streams and
storages used. The client identifies these compound files as page files
with a .PAG extension. The client controls the use of the containing
compound file and provides COTextPage with a pointer to the IStream
interface to load and save its text data in the compound file. The IStream
pointer is passed to COTextPage in calls to the IPersistStreamInit
interface methods.

<P>
COTextPage also exposes an ITextPage custom interface to manipulate the
text that is encapsulated in the text page. ITextPage exposes the
GetLength, GetText, PutText, and Clear methods.

<P>
COTextPage also supports connectable object features. The
IConnectionPointContainer interface is exposed, an appropriate connection
point is implemented, and an outgoing custom ITextPageSink interface is
declared to send notifications to the client.

<P>
The two ITextPage and ITextPageSink custom interfaces are declared in
IPAGES.H located in the common INC directory. PAGEGUID.H, which contains
the GUIDs for the interfaces and objects, is also located in that same
directory.

<P>
The PERTEXT sample uses the CThreaded facility in APPUTIL to achieve
thread safety in the server housing and the class factory. Because the
PERTEXT.DLL is generally accessed from a Single Threaded Apartment (STA)
as an in-process server, COTextPage instances are not coded as thread-safe
using the CThreaded facility. The CLSID_TextPage component is registered
as supporting the apartment threading model.

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of the PERTEXT
sample, see the Code Tour section in PERTEXT.HTM. For details on setting
up the programmatic usage of PERTEXT.DLL, see the Usage section in
PERTEXT.HTM. To read PERTEXT.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the PERTEXT lesson in the table of lessons. You can
also do the same thing by double-clicking the PERTEXT.HTM file after
locating the main tutorial directory in Windows Explorer. For more details
on the PERCLIEN client application and how it works with PERTEXT.DLL, see
also PERCLIEN.HTM in the main tutorial directory. You must build
PERTEXT.DLL before running the PERCLIEN sample.

<P>
The PERTEXT server provides a TextPage component that can create instances
of the COTextPage COM object. COTextPage is housed in the PERTEXT.DLL
in-process server and is made publicly available as a custom COM
component. Like all other servers in this tutorial series, PERTEXT.DLL is
a self-registering COM server. It makes the COTextPage object type
available to clients as the TextPage component in the PERTEXT server using
a CLSID_TextPage registration in the Registry.

<P>
PERTEXT's makefile automatically registers its TextPage COM component in
the registry, which it must do before clients can use PERTEXT.DLL as a
server for the TextPage component. This self-registration is started in
the makefile using the REGISTER.EXE utility built in the REGISTER sample.
To build or run PERTEXT.DLL, you must build the REGISTER code sample
first.

<P>
For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

<P>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>
To use PERTEXT.DLL, a client program does not need to include PERTEXT.H or
link to PERTEXT.LIB. A COM client of PERTEXT.DLL obtains access solely
through its object's CLSID and COM services. For PERTEXT.DLL, that CLSID
is CLSID_TextPage (defined in PAGEGUID.H in the INC sibling directory).
The PERCLIEN code sample shows how the client obtains this access.

<p>
PERTEXT.DLL is intended primarily as a COM server. Although it can be
implicitly loaded by linking to its associated .LIB file, it is normally
used after an explicit LoadLibrary call, usually from within COM's
CoGetClassObject function. PERTEXT.DLL is a self-registering in-process
server.

<P>
The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the PERTEXT directory:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  nmake register
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This assumes that you have a compilation environment set up. If not, you
can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the PERTEXT directory.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  ..\register\register.exe pertext.dll
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
These registration commands require a prior build of both the REGISTER
sample and PERTEXT.DLL.

<P>
In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Microsoft Platform SDK and Visual
C++&reg; include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which can be used in a similar
fashion to register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.

<h4>Run the Sample</h4>

<p>
The client sample and other related samples must be compiled before
you can run the client. For more details on building the samples, see
<a href="using.htm#building">Building the Code Samples.</a>

<P>
If you have already built the appropriate samples, PERCLIEN.EXE is the
client executable to run for this sample.

<a href="perclien\perclien.exe">Click here to run PERCLIEN.EXE.</a>

<P>
Depending on the security level of your browser you may see a dialog
allowing you to either open the .EXE file or save it to disk. Click the
"Open it" choice and then click the OK button.

PERTEXT.DLL uses many of the utility classes and services provided by
APPUTIL. For more details on APPUTIL, study the APPUTIL library's source
code in the sibling APPUTIL directory and APPUTIL.HTM in the main tutorial
directory.

<p>
This sample is part of a graduated series of tutorial code samples and
assumes that you have had some exposure to those samples. It does not
revisit basic interface implementation techniques, COM object
construction, in-process server construction, class factory construction,
connectable object construction, or use of structured storage in compound
files. For information on these topics, study the earlier tutorial
samples.

<p>The major topics covered in this code tour are:

<ul>
<li>How PERTEXT works with connected clients

<li>COTextPage's use of the ITextPage interface for managing text pages.

<li>The data constructs that make up COTextPage's persistent data.

<li>COTextPage's implementation of the IPersistStreamInit interface to
    provide persistence.

<li>COTextPage's use of the ITextPageSink interface for client notifications.

</ul>

<p>
The COTextPage COM object is the single object type managed by this
PERTEXT in-process server. COTextPage is a connectable COM object that
implements the IConnectionPointContainer standard interface, the
IPersistStreamInit standard interface, and the ITextPage custom interface.

<P>
COTextPage exposes the ITextPage custom interface so clients can perform a
small set of operations on the text data that is encapsulated by
COTextPage. Here is a summary of the ITextPage methods from IPAGES.H
located in the common INC directory.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  GetLength
    Get the current length (in WCHARs) of the text page.

  GetText
    Get the current page text held in this object.

  PutText
    Put specified wide character text of specified length
    into this text page object. Does not save persistently.

  Clear
    Clears all text from the entire text page.
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The implementation of ITextPage is straightforward: a set of properties
for the text page is maintained and the text data itself is maintained.
For more details, see TEXTPAGE.H and TEXTPAGE.CPP.

<p>
COTextPage manages its text data in RAM. However, since COTextPage is also
a persistent object, it also manages the persistent image of this text
data in a stream of a structured storage compound file. COTextPage exposes
the IPersistStreamInit interface so that clients can control the
perisitence features of COTextPage. The implementation of
IPersistStreamInit in COTextPage is the principal focus of this sample.

<p>
The client is responsible for a presentation of the text to the user. In
PERCLIEN a standard multiline edit control in a separate window is used.
The client uses the ITextPage interface on COTextPage to obtain the data
for display in this edit control and to update COTextPage with any
user-requested changes to the text data. The client cooperates with
COTextPage to manage the text data. The client manages creation or opening
of a stream in the compound file containing the data. When the client
needs to control the persistence of COTextPage it passes an IStream
interface to COTextPage, usually during calls to the IPersistStreamInit
Load and Save methods. COTextPage then uses that stream for all its
persistent storage of its object state data.

<P>
Two major data constructs are stored for COTextPage's state data: the page
text and the page text properties. The text data is stored in the page's
data stream as a wide character string. The persistent properties are
stored in the same stream. Here is the TEXTPROPS structure from
TEXTPAGE.H.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  // Properties of the TextPage.
  typedef struct _TEXTPROPS
  {
    ULONG ulVersion;
    ULONG ulMaxLength;
    ULONG ulLength;
    WCHAR wszTitle[PAGE_TITLE_SIZE];
  } TEXTPROPS;
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The ulVersion member holds a version number for the text page. This allows
the first member to be checked to determine possible variations in
treatment based on the text page version.

<P>
The ulMaxLength member holds the maximum length that the text page can
grow.

<P>
The ulLength member holds the current length of the page text.

<P>
The wszTitle member is for future evolution of the application and are
not used by PERTEXT or PERCLIEN.

<p>
In the division of labor between client and server, COTextPage does not
create the compound file that is used to store text page data. To both
Save and Load the persistent data the client uses the Save and Load
methods of the IPersistStreamInit interface, passing an IStream interface
pointer for a stream located in an existing compound file. COTextPage then
uses the IStream interface to read and write data in the compound file.

<P>
The following code is the declaration of the COTextPage COM object from
TEXTPAGE.H:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">

  };
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
COTextPage has nested implementations of the IUnknown,
IConnectionPointContainer, IPersistStreamInit, and ITextPage interfaces.
The techniques of these interface implementations follow the pattern used
in earlier samples. The COMOBJ sample, for example, implemented IUnknown
and the CONSERVE sample implemented IConnectionPointContainer. This
samples introduces the ITextPage custom interface, but its implementation
is very similar to the custom interface implementations in many previous
samples.

<P>
The m_TextProps member is a TEXTPROPS structure that holds properties of
the text page. See above for a summary of the TEXTPROPS structure. The
m_ClassID stores the CLSID of the COTextPage component for later use
within the method implementations of COTextPage. The m_bInitNew member is
indicates whether the object was newly initialized by the
IPersistStreamInit::InitNew method. The m_bDirty member is used internally
to determine when the RAM-resident text data has changed relative to the
last time it was loaded from or saved to persistent storage.

<P>
COTextPage keeps the text data in a RAM-resident string the pointer to
which is kept in the m_pwszPageText variable. The string is initially
allocated during either IPersistStreamInit::Load or
IPersistStreamInit::InitNew after COTextPage is created. The following
paragraphs discuss IPersistStreamInit methods in more detail.

<P>
The following IPersistStreamInit methods are declared:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
    STDMETHODIMP         GetClassID(CLSID* pClassID);
    STDMETHODIMP         IsDirty(void);
    STDMETHODIMP         Load(IStream* pIStream);
    STDMETHODIMP         Save(IStream* pIStream, BOOL bClearDirty);
    STDMETHODIMP         GetSizeMax(ULARGE_INTEGER* pcbSize);
    STDMETHODIMP         InitNew(void);
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Examining these methods in detail shows how the implementation of the
standard IPersistStreamInit interface provides persistence for the text
and property data in COTextPage. If you have not used streams (IStream) or
storages (IStorage) in structured storage compound files, see the STOSERVE
and STOCLIEN samples for coverage of this topic.

<P>
Clients call the GetClassID method to obtain the component CLSID of
COTextPage. This method is actually inherited from the IPersist interface
from which IPersistStreamInit is derived. The following code is the
implementation of GetClassID from TEXTPAGE.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP COTextPage::CImpIPersistStreamInit::GetClassID(
                 CLSID* pClassID)

</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This simple method uses the overloaded '=' operator to copy COTextPage's
main copy of the CLSID to the client's address space using the specified
pClassID pointer. The convenient overloading of the '=' operator is
provided in the COM and OLE header files that are included at the front of
TEXTPAGE.CPP. The COTextPage constructor initially assigned the m_ClassID
value to the value CLSID_TextPage, which is defined in the PAGEGUID.H file
located in the common INC directory. PAGEGUID.H contains other GUIDs--such
as interface IIDs--that are used in the PERTEXT, PERTEXT, PERDRAW, and
PERCLIEN samples.

<P>
Clients call the IsDirty method to determine if changes have been made to
this COTextPage's persistent data since it was last loaded, initialized,
or saved. The following code is the implementation of IsDirty from
TEXTPAGE.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP COTextPage::CImpIPersistStreamInit::IsDirty(
                 void)
  {
    HRESULT hr;

    hr = m_pCO-&gt;m_bDirty ? S_OK : S_FALSE;

    return hr;
  }
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This method simply returns the current &quot;dirty&quot; status of the
RAM-resident data in terms of the standard HRESULT return codes of S_OK or
S_FALSE. S_OK means the data needs saving; S_FALSE means the data matches
its counterpart in persistent storage.

<P>
The Load method implementation should not store a copy of the passed
pIStream pointer within COTextPage. The stack copy of the passed stream
interface pointer should be used only within this method call. The
following code is the implementation of Load from TEXTPAGE.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">

</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The Load method is called instead of the InitNew method when the
COTextPage COM object already has a persistent state stored in a stream. A
complete copy of that state data (a group of object properties followed by
the text data) is read from the stream into newly allocated, RAM-resident
space for the data. Load first reads a copy of the TEXTPROPS properties
structure into a temporary NewProps structure. If Load returns
successfully, these properties are copied to COTextPage::m_TextProps. This
is done to allow reverting to the current COTextPage data if Load fails.

<P>
After the m_TextProps are read, the ulVersion property is used in a switch
statement which allows for different load behavior or data formats based
on the version of the data that was stored. Because the version number is
the first thing in stream's data for the object, it can be separately read
to determine how to subsequently read and deal with the data that follows.
The ulMaxLength property is used to allocate a new string character array
in RAM that is big enough for the largest text page permitted. The string
is allocated as an array of wide characters (WCHAR) to accomodate Unicode
strings. After the string is allocated, the text data is read into that
string from the stream. At this point COTextPage has been loaded from
persistent storage, and because this has caused the in-RAM data to match
the file data, the m_bDirty flag is set to FALSE. This means that a save
is currently not needed to achieve such a match.

<P>
If the load is successful, a call to the internal NotifySinks method
notifies all connected clients that the load was completed. This
notification makes use of COTextPage's connectable object features, and
usually triggers an appropriate display of the newly loaded data. If the
load was unsuccessful, a call to the internal Clear method clears the text
page to a safe, empty page.

<P>
Clients call the Save method to command COTextPage to save its persistent
data from RAM to a specified stream in a compound file starting at the
current seek-pointer offset. As with the Load method, the client passes an
IStream pointer Save. On exit from this method the seek pointer is assumed
to be at the end of the data saved. As was discussed above for the Load
method, the rules governing the seek pointer in the Load and Save methods
allow a series of contiguous persistent objects to be saved into the same
stream.

<P>
The Save method, like Load, should not store a copy of the passed pIStream
pointer within COTextPage. The stack copy of the passed stream interface
pointer should be used only within this method call. The following code is
the implementation of Save from TEXTPAGE.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP COTextPage::CImpIPersistStreamInit::Save(
                 IStream* pIStream,
                 BOOL bClearDirty)
  {
    HRESULT hr = E_POINTER;
    ULONG ulToWrite, ulWritten;

    if (NULL != pIStream)
    {
      // Got a stream. Now write data into it.

      // First write TEXTPROPS structure.
      ulToWrite = sizeof(TEXTPROPS);
      hr = pIStream-&gt;Write(&amp;m_pCO-&gt;m_TextProps, ulToWrite, &amp;ulWritten);
      if (SUCCEEDED(hr) &amp;&amp; ulToWrite != ulWritten)
        hr = STG_E_CANTSAVE;
      if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
      {
        // Now write the complete page text data.
        ulToWrite = m_pCO-&gt;m_TextProps.ulLength * sizeof(WCHAR);
        hr = pIStream-&gt;Write(m_pCO-&gt;m_pwszPageText, ulToWrite, &amp;ulWritten);
        if (SUCCEEDED(hr) &amp;&amp; ulToWrite != ulWritten)
          hr = STG_E_CANTSAVE;
        if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
        {
          // Clear this COM object's dirty flag if instructed.
          if (bClearDirty)
            m_pCO-&gt;m_bDirty = FALSE;
        }
      }
    }

    // Notify all other connected clients that TextPage is now saved.
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
      m_pCO-&gt;NotifySinks(TEXTPAGE_EVENT_SAVED);

    return hr;
  }
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The Save method is essentially the reverse of the Load method. The content
of COTextPage's m_TextProps structure is written into the specified stream
at the stream's current seek offset. This structure is essentially a
properties header at the front of the state data. If the TEXTPROPS data is
saved successfully, the current text string data (located in RAM at
m_pwszPageText) is written to the stream. The seek pointer is left
pointing just past the end of the saved text. In either of these data
writes to the stream, if the amount of data actually written does not
equal the amount attempted, the Save method fails and returns
STG_E_CANTSAVE.

<P>
A bClearDirty parameter determines if this method should clear
COTextPage's m_bDirty flag. If bClearDirty is TRUE then
COTextPage::m_bDirty is set to FALSE (that is, cleared). Usually, with a
Save call the RAM-resident data and its corresponding image stored in the
stream will match. However, there may be cases when you want to save to a
stream without clearing COTextPage's dirty flag. This might occur if the
client is saving a copy of the data state to a stream that is different
than the current unsaved stream. If COTextPage is not saved to the
original unsaved stream, the state of m_bDirty will need to be preserved
across the operation. A value of FALSE for the bClearDirty parameter
accomplishes this preservation.

<P>
If the save is successful, a call to the internal NotifySinks method
notifies all connected clients that the save was completed.

<P>
Clients call the GetSizeMax method to obtain the maximum size of the
object state data that can be saved when the Save method is next called.
The following code is the implementation of GetSizeMax from TEXTPAGE.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP COTextPage::CImpIPersistStreamInit::GetSizeMax(
                 ULARGE_INTEGER* pcbSize)
  {
    HRESULT hr = E_POINTER;
    ULONG ulMax = m_pCO-&gt;m_TextProps.ulMaxLength;

    if (NULL != pcbSize)
    {
      ULISet32(*pcbSize, sizeof(TEXTPROPS) + (ulMax * sizeof(WCHAR)));
      hr = NOERROR;
    }

    return hr;
  }
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The caller passes the address of a ULARGE_INTEGER variable that the
GetSizeMax method assigns. The ULISet32 macro (defined in OBJBASE.H)
performs the assignment of the caller's ULARGE_INTEGER variable. Clients
can use this assigned variable to set the size of a stream using
IStream::SetSize. This may be necessary if the client is saving multiple
objects in the same stream. If it is known in advance within COTextPage,
GetSizeMax should return the maximum potential size that a future Save
would consume in the stream.

<P>
Clients call the InitNew method to instruct COTextPage to initialize its
object state data in RAM for the first time. InitNew is called instead of
Load when the newly created object instance must be initialized with new
data rather than with persistent data previously saved in a stream. The
following is the implementation of InitNew from TEXTPAGE.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP COTextPage::CImpIPersistStreamInit::InitNew(
                 void)
  {
    HRESULT hr = E_FAIL;
    WCHAR* pwszPageText;

    if (!m_pCO-&gt;m_bInitNew)
    {
      // There is no previous persistent data for this COTextPage object.
      // Create and init a new persistence data for an empty text page.

      // Allocate an page text array big enough for the largest text page.
      // This maximum is hard-coded here for this Version 1.0 of Text Pages.
      pwszPageText = new WCHAR[(LONG) TEXTPAGE_V10_MAX];
      if (NULL != pwszPageText)
      {
        m_pCO-&gt;m_pwszPageText = pwszPageText;
        // Use the private Clear method to clear the new text array and to
        // set the Page Properties structure appropriately. Also sets dirty.
        hr = m_pCO-&gt;Clear(TRUE);
        m_pCO-&gt;m_bInitNew = TRUE;
      }
      else
        hr = E_OUTOFMEMORY;
    }
    else
      hr = E_UNEXPECTED;

    return hr;
  }
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
You must call either InitNew or Load (but not both) to command COTextPage
to assign its state data. COTextPage's m_bInitNew flag is used to enforce
this rule. If you call InitNew when m_bInitNew is TRUE then the method
will fail and return the E_UNEXPECTED error. The Load method uses the same
logic to return the E_UNEXPECTED error if m_bInitNew is TRUE. When
COTextPage is created it assigns m_bInitNew to FALSE in the constructor.
During InitNew, if initialization is successful, it sets m_bInitNew to
TRUE. By doing this, any subsequent calls to Load (or to InitNew again)
fail by returning E_UNEXPECTED.

<P>
If InitNew successfully creates a new text string array for COTextPage,
COTextPage's internal Clear method is used to fill the string array with
zeroes, initialize appropriate constants to the members of m_TextProps,
and initialize the m_bDirty flag. The dirty flag is assigned to TRUE
because a later save to file is needed for this persistent COTextPage
object.

<p>
COTextPage exposes the IConnectionPointContainer interface so clients can
connect to COTextPage and receive notifications of certain events that
occur in COTextPage. By exposing this interface, COTextPage is seen by
clients as a connectable object. A client can call QueryInterface for this
interface and use it to obtain the object's connection points.

<p>
The client implements what is called a <i>sink</i> in the form of a sink
object with a sink interface. The sink interface receives outgoing event
notification calls from COTextPage after the sink is properly connected by
the client to a COTextPage instance. The client makes the connection by
using a connection point object that is managed by COTextPage. (For more
detailed information on the client participation in this scheme, see the
PERCLIEN sample.)  There can be numerous connection points on a single
connectable COM object, but in the PERTEXT sample, COTextPage has only one
connection point to handle text page events.

<p>
Any number of clients can connect to a single connection point. The
CONNPOINT_TEXTPAGESINK connection point in COTextPage maintains a group of
connections that can grow dynamically at run time. The full implementation
of COTextPage's connectable object support is coded in files CONNECT.H and
CONNECT.CPP and will not be covered here. The construction is very similar
to that in the CONSERVE code sample.

<p>
The PERCLIEN client implements appropriate sink objects for the connection
points it expects to find in COTextPage. From the context of COTextPage,
the sink object that PERCLIEN implements exposes the ITextPageSink
interface. This is the outgoing interface used by COTextPage to notify
PERCLIEN of various events in COTextPage. Here is a summary of the methods
in ITextPageSink from IPAGES.H in the common INC directory.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  Loaded
    The TextPage was loaded from a persistent stream.

  Saved
    The TextPage was saved to a persistent stream.

  Put
    New text content was put into the TextPage object.

  Cleared
    The entire TextPage was cleared.
</FONT> </PRE>

<p>
These methods are largely self-explanatory. The Loaded, Put, and Cleared
methods implemented in the client sink will typically trigger a redisplay
of the text page. Although the sink must implement all these methods in
some fashion, many are implemented as stubs and are not used in the
PERTEXT and PERCLIEN samples.
