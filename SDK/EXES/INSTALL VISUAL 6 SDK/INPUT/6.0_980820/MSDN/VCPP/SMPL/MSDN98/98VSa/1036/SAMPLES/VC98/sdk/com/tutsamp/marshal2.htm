<h2><a name="MARSHAL2">MARSHAL2 - Marshaling DLL Self-Registration</a></h2>

<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
The MARSHAL2 sample shows an alternate and more advanced technique for
building a proxy/stub marshaling DLL for the ICar, IUtility, and ICruise
custom interfaces. The previous MARSHAL sample illustrated the system
default method of producing the marshaling DLL. That method controlled the
conditional compilation of the DLLDATA.C file to generate default
definitions for the DllMain, DllRegisterServer, and DllUnregisterServer
functions in the DLL. WMARSHAL2 does not generate these default functions.
Instead, they coded explicitly.  Thus, this lesson has more detail on the
content of these functions.

<P>
Although the default definitions of these functions are adequate for most
programming, there may be occasions when you want more control over the
content of the marshaling DLL. For example, you might want to perform some
action within DllMain during DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, you might want to code
explicit control over the registration and unregistration of the
marshaling server, or you might want to add standard module version
information to the DLL resources. This sample covers these areas.

<P>
As in the MARSHAL sample, the Microsoft&reg; Interface Definition Language
compiler (MIDL.EXE) is used to compile the interface definitions
(expressed using the MIDL language in the MICARS.IDL file). MIDL.EXE is a
utility provided as part of the Microsoft Platform Software Development
Kit (SDK). The MIDL compilation of MICARS.IDL generates additional source
files: MICARS.H, MICARS_I.C, MICARS_P.C, and DLLDATA.C.

<P>
In the series of COM Tutorial code samples, MARSHAL2 is an alternate
marshaling DLL that can replace MARSHAL.DLL produced in the MARSHAL sample
and can work with later samples in the series to provide standard
marshaling for the custom ICar, IUtility, and ICruise interfaces. To
achieve this, just register MARSHAL2.DLL. This will override any previous
registration of MARSHAL.DLL. Since both of these DLLs provide proxy/stub
marshaling for the same interfaces, the one registered most recently will
replace the other if it is registered.

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of MARSHAL2, see the
Code Tour section in MARSHAL2.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of MARSHAL2, see the Usage section in MARSHAL2.HTM. To
read MARSHAL2.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the MARSHAL2 lesson in the table of lessons. You can also do the
same thing by double-clicking the MARSHAL2.HTM file after locating the
main tutorial directory in Windows Explorer. For a simpler way to provide
the same standard marshaling functionality that MARHSAL2 provides, see
MARSHAL.HTM.

<P>
The subsequent samples in the series that require marshaling of the ICar,
IUtility, and ICruise interfaces normally rely on the registration of
MARSHAL.DLL as the marshaling DLL. MARSHAL.DLL is produced in the previous
MARSHAL sample. MARSHAL2's makefile does not automatically register
MARSHAL2.DLL as the marshaling DLL for those car-related interfaces.
However, this registration can be enabled in MARSHAL2's makefile by
uncommenting the appropriate lines. Registering MARSHAL2 will replace any
prior registration of MARSHAL.DLL. Although, these two marshaling DLLs are
functionally equivalent, there are subtle differences in how they perform
their self-registration. For more details on how MARSHAL2.DLL performs
self-registration see below.

<P>
If enabled in the makefile, MARSHAL2's self-registration is done using the
REGISTER.EXE utility built in the REGISTER sample. To build or run
MARSHAL2, you should build the REGISTER code sample first.

<P>
For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

<P>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<P>
MARSHAL2 is a DLL that is built solely as a marshaling DLL for the
specified interfaces. Although it can be implicitly loaded by linking to
its associated .LIB file, it is normally used on behalf of a COM client
that functions the server across apartment, process, or machine
boundaries. COM loads this DLL automatically in these situations. Before
COM can find and load MARSHAL2.DLL to support marshaling of its supported
interfaces, the MARSHAL2 server must be registered in the registry as the
marshaling server for those interfaces. MARSHAL2 is a self-registering
in-process server. If enabled (see above), the makefile that builds this
sample automatically registers the server in the registry. You can
manually initiate its self-registration by issuing the following command
at the command prompt in the MARSHAL2 directory:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  nmake register
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This assumes that you have a compilation environment set up. If not, you
can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the MARSHAL2 directory.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  ..\register\register.exe marshal2.dll
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
These registration commands require a prior build of both the REGISTER
sample and the MARSHAL2 sample.

<P>
In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Microsoft Platform SDK and Visual
C++&reg; include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which can be used in a similar
fashion to register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.

<P>
This code sample covers explicit definitions of the DllMain,
DllRegisterServer, and DllUnregisterServer functions in a standard
marshaling server which duplicates the functionality of the MARSHAL sample
by providing standard marshaling for the same ICar, IUtility, and ICruise
custom interfaces. For more details on the general topic of standard
marshaling, see the MARSHAL sample. This sample focuses primarily on
coding an explicit DLL framework for the marshaling server.

<P>
MARSHAL2 uses many of the utility classes and services provided by APPUTIL.
For more details on APPUTIL, study the APPUTIL library's source code in
the sibling APPUTIL directory and APPUTIL.HTM in the main tutorial
directory.

<P>
MARSHAL2.DLL is very similar to the in-process COM servers produced in
earlier samples and is a COM server that offers standard marshaling
services for the interfaces it is registered to handle. You create
MARSHAL2 DLL by compiling some source files that are automatically
generated by the MIDL compiler when it processes the primary source for
this sample, MICARS.IDL. This file defines the custom interfaces.

<P>
The MARSHAL2 DLL is coded in much the same way as the DLLSERVE server from
an earlier lesson. A good place to start looking at the code is the DLL
framework code in MARSHAL2.CPP. The following files are included by
MARSHAL2.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
  #include &lt;ole2.h&gt;
  #include &lt;apputil.h&gt;
  #include &quot;micars.h&quot;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The MIDL compiler generates MICARS.H when it compiles MICARS.IDL. MICARS.H
looks very similar to the ICARS.H interface declaration file from previous
samples in this series. MICARS.H is used as an include file when compiling
the clients and servers that require the interface marshaling it supports.
It is included by MARSHAL2.CPP when MARSHAL2.DLL is compiled by the C++
compiler. In the LOCCLIEN sample, LOCCLIEN.CPP also includes this file for
its declarations of the ICar, IUtility, and ICruise interfaces. Because
the later samples like LOCSERVE and LOCCLIEN rely on MARSHAL.DLL, the
MARSHAL2 makefile copies the generated MICARS.H file to the common INC
directory.

<P>
The rest of MARSHAL2.CPP should be familiar. The DllMain function and the
self-registration functions DllRegisterServer and DllUnregisterServer were
presented in earlier lessons. The DllMain coded explicitly in this sample
allows you to honor DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH and DLL_PROCESS_DETACH.

<P>
Server registration and unregistration is different now, because
interfaces, rather than components, are being registered and unregistered.
The follow is the DllRegisterServer function from MARSHAL2.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDAPI DllRegisterServer(void)
  {
    HRESULT  hr = NOERROR;
    TCHAR    szID[GUID_SIZE+1];
    TCHAR    szIFace[GUID_SIZE+32];
    TCHAR    szCLSID[GUID_SIZE+32];
    TCHAR    szModulePath[MAX_PATH];

    // Obtain the path to this module's executable file for later use.
    GetModuleFileName(
      g_hDllInst,
      szModulePath,
      sizeof(szModulePath)/sizeof(TCHAR));

    /*---------------------------------------------------------------------
      Create registry entries for the ICar Interface.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------*/
    // Create some base key strings.
    StringFromGUID2(IID_ICar, szID, GUID_SIZE);
    lstrcpy(szIFace, TEXT(&quot;Interface\\&quot;));
    lstrcat(szIFace, szID);
    lstrcpy(szCLSID, TEXT(&quot;CLSID\\&quot;));
    lstrcat(szCLSID, szID);

    // Create the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Interface entries.
    SetRegKeyValue(
      szIFace,
      NULL,
      TEXT(&quot;ICar&quot;));
    SetRegKeyValue(
      szIFace,
      TEXT(&quot;ProxyStubClsid32&quot;),
      szID);
    SetRegKeyValue(
      szIFace,
      TEXT(&quot;NumMethods&quot;),
      TEXT(&quot;7&quot;));

    // Create the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID entries.
    SetRegKeyValue(
      szCLSID,
      NULL,
      TEXT(&quot;ICar Proxy/Stub Factory&quot;));
    SetRegKeyValue(
      szCLSID,
      TEXT(&quot;InprocServer32&quot;),
      szModulePath);

    ...
    ...
      // Similar code for the IUtility and ICruise interfaces.
    ...
    ...

    return hr;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The ICar interface registration appears under two main registry keys:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Interface\[guid] and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\[guid].
Note that this sample assumes that all registration is under the main
registry key of HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. The content of the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
branch is replicated under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes. These two
branches of the Registry can be used interchangeably.

<P>
The CLSIDs used above in DllRegisterServer are the same as the GUIDS
defined for the interfaces. In this case, they are defined in MICARS.IDL,
and the MIDL compiler places them in the generated MICARS.H file. The
reference above to IID_ICar is thus given meaning by MICARS.H which is an
include file at the beginning of MARSHAL2.CPP. The double use of the
interface GUIDs as CLSIDs is permitted because the interface IID will not
be confused with the server's CLSID--the same GUID can be safely used for
completely different things.

<P>
The registration code above differs from the default registration code
used in the previous MARSHAL sample, which used the first interface GUID
(IID_ICar) as the CLSID. In that sample, the ICar, IUtility, and ICruise
proxy/stub marshaling components were all registered under that single
CLSID. However, in DllRegisterServer above, each interface marshaling
component is registered with a different CLSID. These CLSIDs are IID_ICar,
IID_IUtility, and IID_ICruise. Thus, in this sample there is a separate
CLSID entry for each marshaled interface. This variation is possible here
because of the explicit control over the coding of DllRegisterServer and
DllUnregisterServer. Of course, your explicit coding of these functions
could just as well mimic the single CLSID technique used in the default
functions of the MARSHAL sample.

<P>
The value of the NumMethods entry is a count that includes both the
IUnknown methods and the methods unique to the interface. For the ICar
interface entry above, the count is 7, including three methods for
IUnknown (QueryInterface, AddRef, Release) and four for ICar (Shift,
Clutch, Speed, Steer).

<P>
After you enable registration in the makefile (see above) and build this
code sample, you can view the registered entries using the Registry Editor
(REGEDT32.EXE for Windows NT, REGEDIT.EXE for Windows 95). MARSHAL2's
registry entries for the ICar interface look like the following:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
     \CLSID
        \{0002DA00-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} = &quot;ICar Proxy/Stub Factory&quot;
           \InprocServer32 = &quot;D:\TUTSAMP\MARSHAL2\MARSHAL2.DLL&quot;

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
     \Interface
         \{0002DA00-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} = &quot;ICar&quot;
           \ProxyStubClsid32 = &quot;{0002DA00-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}&quot;
           \NumMethods = &quot;7&quot;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID, this marshaling DLL appears with the
in-process COM server entry, InprocServer32. COM treats this standard
marshaling server as an in-process server.

<P>
As in earlier lessons, the DllUnregisterServer function in MARSHAL2.CPP
simply removes the registry entries created by the DllRegisterServer
function. For example, see DllUnregisterServer in MARSHAL2.CPP.

<P>
One final note about the self-registration of MARSHAL2.DLL. As in other
self-registering COM servers in this tutorial series, for instructional
purposes we have written our own support for registration and
unregistration. You, however, can forgo writing a main module file like
MARSHAL2.CPP and a main module resource file like MARSHAL2.RC, and instead
easily obtain a default implementation for DllMain, DllRegisterServer, and
DllUnregisterServer by conditionally compiling your code. You do this by
setting a compilation switch, -DREGISTER_PROXY_DLL, when you compile
DLLDATA.C. For more details see the MARSHAL sample.

<P>
You may have noticed that MARSHAL2.CPP lacks the familiar COM in-process
server functions DllGetClassObject and DllCanUnloadNow. As in the MARSHAL
standard marshaling sample, explicit definitions of these functions are
not needed because compiling DLLDATA.C generates default implementations
for you. Those implementations, however, must still be exported from this
DLL. Standard marshaling DLLs require the DllGetClassObject,
DllCanUnloadNow, and GetProxyDllInfo exports. You need only export these
three functions; you don't need to implement them within this standard
marshaling DLL. Of course, you must also export the DllRegisterServer and
DllUnregisterServer functions if you have defined them in the DLL.

<P>
From the makefile, the following linker switches that direct the Link of
MARSHAL2 DLL:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  # Link the object and resource binaries into the target DLL binary.
  # Build the import LIB file so apps can link to and use this DLL.
  $(DLL).dll: $(DLLOBJS) $(TDIR)\$(DLL).res
      $(LINK)  @&lt;&lt;
      $(LINKFLAGS) $(dlllflags)
      -out:$@
      -base:0x1C000000
      -def:$*.def
      -implib:$*.lib
      -map:$(TDIR)\$*.map
      $(DLLOBJS)
      $(TDIR)\$*.res
      $(olelibsdll) $(APPLIBS)
  &lt;&lt;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
As used in the MARSHAL sample, the Link of MARSHAL2.DLL uses a -def
command line switch to specify a MARSHAL2.DEF file to use for the export
of the necessary marshaling server functions. The following is
MARSHAL2.DEF:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
