<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
This sample introduces COM objects.

<P>
An object is a software construct that encapsulates or packages some
data and some public methods that operate on that data.  The data is often
said to be "hidden" while the methods are exposed as the chief means to
access the data.  At compile time, programming languages provide varying
degrees of syntactic support to express objects. For example, the C++
language offers a Class syntactic construct to express an abstract type
(or class) of object. However, this C++ Class construct does allow for
public access to an object's data. An object class is an abstraction that
refers to an open-ended set of potential objects of the same specific
kind. Objects are real things that occupy memory with their data and code
instantiated in live binary form. The 'object' term typically refers to
the runtime behavior of the this real software thing.

<P>
A COM object is a kind of object that originated with Microsoft's
Component Object Model (COM). COM objects completely hide their data and
expose their methods through a construct called an interface.  A COM
interface is a grouping of related methods that is uniquely identified for
all programs and all time (by an Interface ID).  Interfaces are used to
encapsulate COM object feature sets.  The most fundamental feature set in
COM gives COM objects their nature as COM objects. The IUnknown interface
exposes this feature set in several methods (AddRef, Release, and
QueryInterface) that determine the common behavior governing all COM
object lifetimes and how interfaces on COM objects are properly acquired.

<P>
Outside users of a COM object can only use the object by acquiring one of
its interfaces.  This acquisition of an interface is achieved by obtaining
a pointer to the COM object's implementation of the interface.  COM
objects &quot;know&quot; about the interfaces they expose to clients and
can provide pointer references to the interface implementations. Likewise,
COM objects know about how many interface references they have handed out
to clients and can thus control their own lifetime. When no references
remain, the object normally removes itself from memory and ceases to
exist.

<P>
The COMOBJ DLL offers several car-related COM object classes. Because
COMOBJ.DLL supports no object handlers, class factories, full in-process
servers, or marshaling, it is not a full-blown COM Server. Rather, it is
a primitive precursor to a COM in-process server.

<P>
This DLL exposes the following COM objects: COCar, COUtilityCar, and
COCruiseCar. Appropriate create functions are exported from this DLL:
CreateCar, CreateUtilityCar, and CreateCruiseCar.

<P>
In this tutorial, COMOBJ works with the COMUSER code sample to show how an
EXE client (COMUSER.EXE) calls COM object creation services and
manipulates the COM objects that are created.

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of COMOBJ, see the
Code Tour section in COMOBJ.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of COMOBJ, see the Usage section in COMOBJ.HTM. To read
COMOBJ.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and click the
COMOBJ lesson in the table of lessons. You can also achieve the same thing
by clicking the COMOBJ.HTM file after locating the main tutorial directory
in the Windows Explorer. See also COMUSER.HTM in the main tutorial
directory for more details on the COMUSER client application and how it
works with COMOBJ.DLL itself. You must build COMOBJ.DLL before building
COMUSER. The makefile for COMOBJ copies the necessary COMOBJ.H,
COMOBJ.LIB, and COMOBJ.DLL files to the appropriate sibling directories
once the files are built. The .H goes to \INC, the .LIB goes to \LIB, and
the .DLL goes to \COMUSER.

<P>
In general, to set up your system to build and test the code samples in
this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM for details. The supplied
makefile is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the
NMAKE command at the command prompt.

<h4>Usage</h4>

<P>
COMOBJ is a DLL that you can access from .EXE modules either by performing
an explicit LoadLibrary call or implicitly loading the DLL by linking to
its associated import library (.LIB) file. In either case, you need to
include COMOBJ.H to declare the functions that are defined as exported in
the COMOBJ DLL. In this lesson, a representative COMUSER.EXE application
is provided to illustrate the programmatic use of COMOBJ.DLL. COMUSER is
built in the COMUSER lesson (in sibling directory COMUSER). See below for
more details.

<h4>Run the Sample</h4>

<p>
The client sample and other related samples must be compiled before
you can run the client. For more details on building the samples, see
<a href="using.htm#building">
Building the Code Samples.</a>

<P>
If you have already built the appropriate samples, COMUSER.EXE is the
client executable to run for this sample.

<a href="COMUSER\COMUSER.exe">
Click here to run COMUSER.EXE.</a>

<P>
Depending on the security level of your browser you may see a dialog
allowing you to either open the .EXE file or save it to disk. Click the
"Open it" choice and then click the OK button.

 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This code sample is based on the code in DLLSKEL. See the DLLSKEL code
tour in the sibling DLLSKEL directory for more detail on the DLL skeleton.

<P>
COMOBJ makes use of many of the utility classes and services provided by
APPUTIL. For more details on APPUTIL, study the source code in the sibling
APPUTIL directory and tutorial file APPUTIL.HTM in the main tutorial
directory.

<P>
In the context of this tutorial, the goal of COMOBJ is to use a C++ DLL
framework to illustrate various techniques for constructing COM objects.
The DLL acts as a primitive server for several simple COM objects. Later
in this series, COM objects are shown housed as COM component objects in
COM servers. COM components are COM object types that have associated
class factories, are housed in COM servers, and are registered in the
registry.

<P>
The COM objects that are used in both the COMUSER and COMOBJ code samples
represent sport utility vehicles. We invent some basic feature sets that
are available for modeling such car objects. These feature sets are
implemented as custom interfaces in COM objects. Custom interfaces are
created by application programmers and are declared in the application's
header files. In contrast to custom interfaces, standard interfaces (e.g.,
IUnknown) are provided by COM and are pre-declared in COM's system header
files. In this sample, three custom COM interfaces are created to roughly
model some feature sets on real cars: ICar, IUtility, and ICruise.

<P>
The most basic interface, ICar, has the following methods: Shift, Clutch,
Speed, and Steer. Through this interface, car objects can be commanded to:

<ol>
<li>
Shift. Shift the 5-speed manual transmission (1 - 5 forward; 6 reverse).

<li>
Clutch. Engage the engine to, or disengage it from, the transmission.

<li>
Speed. Accelerate or decelerate the car to a specified speed in miles per
hour.

<li>
Steer. Steer the car by turning the steering wheel to point the car at a
specified angle.

</ol>

<p>
The IUtility Interface can add off-road and 4-wheel drive utility systems
to our car objects: Offroad and Winch. Through this interface, these car
objects can:

<ol>
<li>
Offroad. Set the transfer case gear to the specified gear (0 = 2H or
regular 2-wheel drive; 1 = 4H or 4-wheel drive high speed; 2 = neutral;
and 3 = 4L or 4-wheel drive low speed).

<li>
Winch. Turn on/off the front-mounted winch.

</ol>

<p>
The ICruise interface can add automatic cruise control methods to our car
objects: Engage, Adjust. Through this interface these car objects can:

<ol>
<li>
Engage. Turn the cruise control system on or off.

<li>
Adjust. Adjust the cruising speed up or down by 3 mph.

</ol>

<P>
Using these interfaces, COMOBJ exposes three COM object classes: COCar,
COUtilityCar, and COCruiseCar. COCar exposes the basic ICar interface.
COUtilityCar exposes the ICar and IUtility interfaces. COCruiseCar exposes
the ICar and ICruise interfaces. So COCars have basic Car behavior (ICar).
UtilityCars have basic Car behavior (ICar) with offroad utility systems
(IUtility). COCruiseCars have basic Car behavior (ICar) with a cruise
control system (ICruise).

<P>
COCar is a COM object class that exposes a native implementation of the
ICar interface. The multiple interfaces of COCar are implemented using the
nested class technique.

<P>
COUtilityCar is a COM object class that exposes a native implementation of
the IUtility interface and reuses the COCar class and its ICar interface
by containment. The multiple interfaces of COUtilityCar are implemented
using the nested class technique.

<P>
COCruiseCar is a COM object class that exposes a native implementation of
the ICruise interface and reuses the COCar class and its ICar interface by
aggregation. The multiple interfaces of COCruiseCar are implemented using
the nested class technique.

<P>
COM objects created from these three classes can be used by client
software only as in-process COM objects. No object handler or marshaling
is provided, and simple creation functions are supplied instead of fully
functioning class factories. The idea here is to keep it simple to
illustrate COM object interface augmentation and the COM object reuse
techniques of containment and aggregation.

<P>
COMOBJ.H is an important file not only for compiling COMOBJ.DLL, but also
for outside users of the DLL. As with DLLSKEL.H in the DLLSKEL code
sample, this include file serves double duty by defining certain functions
as exported and also declaring those functions as imported, depending on
how COMOBJ.H is included.

<P>
COMOBJ.H uses the #if !defined(RC_INCLUDE) block to exclude the contents
of this file if someone includes it in an .RC file. RC_INCLUDE is defined
on the RC compiler invocation command lines. See RCFLAGS in the makefiles.
In general, COMOBJ.H is written to support either C or C++ programs.

<P>
In ICARS.H in the sibling \INC directory, the car-related interfaces are
declared. CARGUIDS.H is in the same common directory and defines the GUIDs
for the interfaces. CARGUIDS.H also contains the CLSIDs for the class
factories of the main COM object classes. Class Factories are not used in
this code sample but will be studied in future lessons. So these two files
are common include files used by the current code sample as well as future
ones.

<P>
If your project consists of a suite of executables that all manage a
common set of COM objects and interfaces (as this code sample series
does), it is a good practice to factor out those common interface and GUID
definitions into a common include directory. Such factoring can help you
ensure that there are no conflicts in the interface or GUID definitions
between executables in the application suite.

<P>
First the interfaces. From ICARS.H, here is a representative declaration
for ICar.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  DECLARE_INTERFACE_(ICar, IUnknown)
  {
    // IUnknown methods.
    STDMETHOD(QueryInterface) (THIS_ REFIID, PPVOID) PURE;
    STDMETHOD_(ULONG,AddRef)  (THIS) PURE;
    STDMETHOD_(ULONG,Release) (THIS) PURE;

    // ICar methods.
    STDMETHOD(Shift)   (THIS_ short) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(Clutch)  (THIS_ short) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(Speed)   (THIS_ short) PURE;
    STDMETHOD(Steer)   (THIS_ short) PURE;
  };
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The DECLAREINTERFACE_ macro is used to publicly derive the ICar interface
class from the existing COM IUnknown interface abstract base class. The
STDMETHOD macro declares the method with the standard HRESULT error return
code. The parameter is the method name. The STDMETHOD_ macro is used when
the method returns something other than HRESULT. For example, in AddRef
above, a ULONG return type is specified. THIS is used when the method
accepts the void parameter. THIS_ is used when parameter types are
accepted and those types are specified in parameter order. The PURE macro
(in C++ it reduces to '=0') designates these methods as pure virtual
functions, as all methods in C++ interface declarations must be. In C,
this macro reduces to nothing.  With these macros, you should be able to
use the services of COMOBJ.DLL from either C or C++ programs.

<P>
A standard part of every interface is an IUnknown implementation, which
includes the three methods QueryInterface, AddRef, and Release. All COM
interfaces are derived from IUnknown. Additional declarations are
necessary for the methods that are unique to each interface (for example,
the Shift, Clutch, Speed, and Steer methods of ICar).

<P>
For this interface to be used in a way fully consistent with COM
interfaces, it needs a globally unique identifier, or GUID, as in
CARGUIDS.H.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  DEFINE_GUID(IID_ICar,
    0x0002da00, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0xc0, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x46);
 </FONT> </PRE>
<P>With this definition, the GUID of the interface can be referred to by the
name IID_ICar.

<P>
This GUID is part of a Microsoft pre-allocated sequence in which the first
value 0x0002DAxx has values of xx in the range 00 to FF. Do not use the
GUIDs in this sequence or any GUIDs in this code sample series elsewhere
in other applications. You can obtain your own unique GUIDs by running the
UUIDGEN utility supplied with the Platform SDK. The following command in
the command prompt window will produce 10 such GUIDs in file GUIDS.C.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  UUIDGEN -s -n10 -oGUIDS.C
 </FONT> </PRE>
<p>This utility uses random number generation techniques to ensure
absolute GUID uniqueness. It produces the GUIDs as a C structure:
<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  INTERFACENAME = { /* b124eec0-e7a9-11ce-9a5f-444553540000 */
      0x3c0869c0,
      0xd721,
      0x11ce,
      {0x9a, 0x5f, 0x44, 0x45, 0x53, 0x54, 0x00, 0x00}
    };
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
This structure is easy to edit into the format required by the DEFINE_GUID
macro as shown above.

<p>
COMOBJ.CPP provides the main exported creation functions for the DLL. It
also has the DllMain function that you saw in DLLSKEL. Because COMOBJ.CPP
brings together the functionality of the DLL, it includes the following
#include statements:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
  #include &lt;ole2.h&gt;
  #include &lt;initguid.h&gt;
  #include &lt;apputil.h&gt;
  #include &lt;icars.h&gt;
  #include &lt;carguids.h&gt;
  #include &quot;comobji.h&quot;
  #define _DLLEXPORT_
  #include &quot;comobj.h&quot;
  #include &quot;car.h&quot;
  #include &quot;utilcar.h&quot;
  #include &quot;crucar.h&quot;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
We include OLE2.H because we will need to call the COM/OLE library
functions. Of special note is INITGUID.H. This file must be included only
once in each executable, just after the other COM/OLE header files are
included. What this ensures is that any GUIDs defined in this application
will be instantiated as named data in the data segment of this executable
DLL. If you do not include this file, you will get unresolved external
references to the IID_IMyInterface GUIDs during linking. We include
ICARS.H for the common car-related interface specifications. We include
CARGUIDS.H for the interface GUID definitions.

<P>
As with DLLSKEL, we confine internal resource identifier macros and
utility classes to a separate file, COMOBJI.H. We define the _DLLEXPORT_
macro to force export definition of the creation functions in this file.
We next include COMOBJ.H for the STDENTRY macro definitions, as well as
the main interfaces already discussed. We include CAR.H, UTILCAR.H, and
CRUCAR.H for the COM object class declarations of the three main objects
exposed by this DLL: COCar, COUtilityCar, and COCruiseCar.

<P>There is a global variable worthy of note:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  // Here is a pointer for use by the global Debug Message logging macros.
  // Set by the ComObjInitMsgLog function call from an outside EXE user.
  CMsgLog* g_pMsgLog = NULL;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The trace message log facility is a simple one that is meant to be global
and nonintrusive. One central set of LOGxx macros all assume the
same-named global variable (ie, g_pMsgLog) regardless of the executable
module. Because the MsgLog window lives in a host EXE which has a message
loop, we define this global variable in the DLL. It is later assigned by a
call from the EXE to the ComObjInitMsgLog function which is also defined
in COMOBJ.

<P>
As a primitive server providing the three COM objects, this DLL exports
three creation functions: CreateCar, CreateUtilityCar, and
CreateCruiseCar. Explicit calls to delete the objects are not needed,
because COM object lifetimes are controlled by their own internal
reference counts. The creation functions provide a requested interface
pointer on the new object. After creation, it is only through interfaces
that the objects are accessible. The Car, UtilityCar, and CruiseCar
objects are all exposed as COM objects that are aggregatable outside this
DLL via the pUnkOuter parameter to their creation functions. Here is a
representative CreateCruiseCar function:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDENTRY CreateCruiseCar(
             IUnknown* pUnkOuter,
             REFIID riid,
             PPVOID ppv)
  {
    HRESULT hr;
    COCruiseCar* pCob;

    LOGF1(&quot;D: CreateCruiseCar. pUnkOuter=0x%X.&quot;,pUnkOuter);

    // If the creation call is requesting aggregation (pUnkOuter != NULL),
    // the COM rules state the IUnknown interface MUST also concomitantly
    // be requested. If it is not so requested (riid != IID_IUnknown), then
    // an error must be returned indicating that no aggregate creation of
    // the COCruiseCar COM Object can be performed.
    if (NULL != pUnkOuter &amp;&amp; riid != IID_IUnknown)
      hr = CLASS_E_NOAGGREGATION;
    else
    {
      // Instantiate a COCruiseCar COM Object.
      pCob = new COCruiseCar(pUnkOuter);
      if (NULL != pCob)
      {
        // If we have succeeded in instantiating the COCruiseCar object,
        // we initialize it to set up any subordinate objects (ie, via
        // containment or aggregation).
        hr = pCob-&gt;Init();
        if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
        {
          // We QueryInterface this new COM Object not only to deposit the
          // requested interface pointer into the caller's pointer variable,
          // but to also automatically bump the Reference Count on the new
          // COM Object after handing out this reference to it.
          hr = pCob-&gt;QueryInterface(riid, (PPVOID)ppv);
        }
      }
      else
        hr = E_OUTOFMEMORY;
    }

    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
      LOGF1(&quot;D: CreateCruiseCar Succeeded. *ppv=0x%X.&quot;,*ppv);

    return hr;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Using the REFIID parameter, this function attempts to return the requested
interface pointer after the COCruiseCar COM object is created. The
QueryInterface method of the new object's IUnknown interface is used to
get the interface pointer. The pUnkOuter parameter determines whether the
object is being aggregated into another object. The CoCruiseCar's Init
method is called to compartmentalize any creation of subordinate objects,
which applies here because a subordinate COCar object is created using
aggregation in this Init method.

<h4>COCar COM Object</h4>

<p>
The COCar COM object class is declared in CAR.H.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  class COCar : public IUnknown
  {
    public:
      // Main Object Constructor &amp; Destructor.
      COCar(IUnknown* pUnkOuter);
      ~COCar(void);

      // IUnknown members. Main object, non-delegating.
      STDMETHODIMP         QueryInterface(REFIID, PPVOID);
      STDMETHODIMP_(ULONG) AddRef(void);
      STDMETHODIMP_(ULONG) Release(void);

          ~CImpICar(void);

          // IUnknown members.

          STDMETHODIMP Speed(short nMph);
          STDMETHODIMP Steer(short nAngle);

        private:
          // Data private to this interface implementation of ICar.
          ULONG        m_cRefI;       // Interface Ref Count (for debugging)
          COCar*       m_pBackObj;    // Parent Object back pointer
          IUnknown*    m_pUnkOuter;   // Outer unknown for Delegation
      };

      // Make the otherwise private and nested ICar interface implementation
      // a friend to COM object instantiations of this selfsame COCar
      // COM object class.
      friend CImpICar;

      // Private data of COCar COM objects.

      // Nested ICar implementation instantiation.  This ICar interface is
      // instantiated inside this COCar object as a native interface.
      CImpICar         m_ImpICar;

      ULONG            m_cRefs;

      // Outer unknown (aggregation &amp; delegation).
      IUnknown*        m_pUnkOuter;
  };
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
The ICar interface is implemented as a nested class. The nested CImpICar
is declared in the private section of the main COCar object class. An
instance of the ICar interface is created in the private section with this
code.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  // Nested ICar implementation instantiation. This ICar interface is
  // instantiated inside this COCar object as a native interface.
  CImpICar        m_ImpICar;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Because the ICar interface implementation is nested in the COCar object
class, no explicit creation and deletion operations are needed. Its
lifetime is tied to the lifetime of the parent COCar object, so it is
automatically constructed and destroyed as the parent object is. To ensure
the CImpICar methods can access the private data of the COCar class,
CImpICar is made a friend ot COCar.

<P>
The constructor function of CImpICar contains two important parameters.
The pBackObj pointer is used by CImpICar methods to access private data in
COCar. The pUnkOuter parameter signals aggregation if it is non-NULL, in
which case it is stored within the CImpICar object and used for later
delegation of calls to its own interfaces' IUnknown methods. More on this
later, when we tour CAR.CPP.

<P>
The m_pUnkOuter variable is used when this object is aggregated inside
another COM object. The value then is a pointer to the outermost
controlling IUnknown, which is passed to the COCar constructor. COCar
supports both containment and aggregation.

<P>
CAR.CPP defines the methods of COCar. The constructor uses an interesting
member initializer to pass the pBackObj and pUnkOuter parameters mentioned
above to the CImpICar constructor. This inner class's constructor is
thereby executed prior to the main COCar constructor.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">

Here is that inner CImpICar::CImpICar constructor.

      m_pUnkOuter = pBackObj;
      LOG(&quot;D: COCar::CImpICar Constructor. Non-Aggregating.&quot;);

      LOG(&quot;D: COCar::CImpICar Constructor. Aggregating.&quot;);
    }

    return;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Note the logic used to assign the delegating m_pUnkOuter pointer. If the
COCar object is not being aggregated (parameter pUnkOUter == NULL),
m_pUnkOuter is assigned the COCar object's 'this' pointer (passed in the
pBackObj parameter of the member initializer pointed out above). In this
case, the ICar interface's IUnknown methods will all be delegated to the
COCar object. If COCar is being aggregated (pUnkOuter != NULL),
m_pUnkOuter is assigned a pointer to the outermost controlling IUnknown
(passed in the pUnkOuter parameter of the member initializer pointed out
above). The pUnkOuter parameter is then passed to the constructor of
COCar. If pUnkOuter is non-NULL, it is passed to any subordinate objects
that are created. It makes the code for the CImpICar IUnknown methods
simple as well--they all blindly delegate through the interface's assigned
m_pUnkOuter pointer. Here, for example, is CImpICar::QueryInterface.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP COCar::CImpICar::QueryInterface(
                 REFIID riid,
                 PPVOID ppv)
  {
    LOG(&quot;D: COCar::CImpICar::QueryInterface. Delegating.&quot;);

    // Delegate this call to the outer object's QueryInterface.
    return m_pUnkOuter-&gt;QueryInterface(riid, ppv);
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
When the COCar object is aggregated, calls to this method are delegated to
the outermost controlling IUnknown. At the outermost aggregating object,
it appears that this ICar interface is on the outer object rather than on
the inner COCar object.

<p>
Since this COCar COM object does not reuse any COM objects, its IUnknown
methods are easy. Here's QueryInterface:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP COCar::QueryInterface(
                 REFIID riid,

    HRESULT hr = E_NOINTERFACE;
    *ppv = NULL;

    if (IID_IUnknown == riid)
    {
      *ppv = this;
      LOG(&quot;D: COCar::QueryInterface. 'this' pIUnknown returned.&quot;);
    }
    else if (IID_ICar == riid)
    {
      *ppv = &amp;m_ImpICar;
      LOG(&quot;D: COCar::QueryInterface. pICar returned.&quot;);
    }

    if (NULL != *ppv)
    {
      // We've handed out a pointer to the interface so obey the COM rules
      // and AddRef the reference count.
      ((LPUNKNOWN)*ppv)-&gt;AddRef();
      hr = NOERROR;
    }

    return (hr);
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
For IID_IUnknown, the 'this' pointer is used, because a pointer to the
object itself is a pointer to the object's IUnknown. For IID_ICar,
QueryInterface passes the address of the nested instance of CImpICar (*ppv
= &amp;m_ImpICar). After passing an interface pointer, QueryInterface
calls AddRef to maintain the object's reference count.

<P>
The &quot;if (IID_Unknown == riid)&quot; comparisons take advantage of an
overloaded C++ == operator. Such overloaded operators are provided in the
COM/OLE headers for types GUID, CLSID, and IID. IIDs are actually the
128-bit (16 byte) integer entities that you saw above.  In C++, these
entities can simply be referred to using references (as with IID_Unknown
above).

<P>
The actual ICar methods (like CImpICar::Shift) in this code sample are
empty LOG announcements that the methods have been called. This is where
the skeleton ends and real application code would be added.

 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
COM objects of the COUtilityCar class augment COCar COM objects (which
expose ICar interface features) with a native implementation of IUtility
interface features (Offroad and Winch). A COUtilityCar COM object class
reuses the COCar COM object class by containment. The multiple interfaces
on this COM object class are implemented as nested classes.

<P>
To supply both the ICar and IUtility interfaces, we implement them in this
COM object. The IUtility interface is a native implementation in the
COUtilityCar COM object. The COUtilityCar object contains a delegating
implementation of the ICar interface, called CImpICar in the sample code.
The whole purpose of CImpICar is to delegate ICar calls to the real ICar
implementation, which is located in a contained COCar object.

<P>
For this implementation, the COUtilityCar object's constructor creates a
COCar object and holds a pointer to the ICar interface of the COCar
object. This pointer is used to delegate calls to ICar methods
(implemented in the COUtilityCar object) to the corresponding method
implemented in the contained object's ICar interface. We declare the
delegation pointer like this:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  // We get this ICar interface pointer via containment reuse of the
  // ICar interface in an instantiated COCar.
  ICar*           m_pICar;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
This delegating pointer is assigned when the COUtilityCar is initialized
by the Init call in the CreateUtilityCar function in COMOBJ.CPP.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  // Instantiate a COUtilityCar COM Object.
  pCob = new COUtilityCar(pUnkOuter);
  if (NULL != pCob)
  {
    // If we have succeeded in instantiating the COUtilityCar object
    // we initialize it to set up any subordinate objects (ie, via
    // containment or aggregation).
    hr = pCob-&gt;Init();
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
      // We QueryInterface this new COM Object not only to deposit the
      // requested interface pointer into the caller's pointer variable,
      // but to also automatically bump the Reference Count on the new
      // COM Object after handing out this reference to it.
      hr = pCob-&gt;QueryInterface(riid, (PPVOID)ppv);
    }
  }
  else
    hr = E_OUTOFMEMORY;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
After creating a COUtilityCar COM object, the object's Init method is
called to create and initialize any inner objects. In this case, an inner
COCar COM object must be created. Here is the Init method (from
UTILCAR.CPP):

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  HRESULT COUtilityCar::Init(void)
  {
    HRESULT hr;

    LOG(&quot;D: COUtilityCar::Init.&quot;);

    // Create an instance of the COCar object and ask for its ICar
    // interface directly. We pass NULL for the pUnkOuter because we
    // are not aggregating. It is here that we are reusing the COCar
    // COM Object through the Containment technique. We cache the
    // pointer to the ICar interface for later delegation use. We
    // don't need to AddRef it here because CreateCar does that for us.
    hr = CreateCar(NULL, IID_ICar, (PPVOID) &amp;m_pICar);

    return (hr);
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
The call to the CreateCar function creates a COCar COM object.
COUtilityCar objects reuse COCar objects by containment, not aggregation,
so the pUnkOuter parameter is NULL. Since the COCar COM object is not
aggregated, CreateCar can explicitly ask it for its IID_ICar interface.
The output parameter passes the address of the m_pICar delegation pointer
(&amp;m_pICar).

<p>
In UTILCAR.CPP, the IUnknown methods of CImpIUtility all delegate as was
done for the ICar implementation in COCar (through the interface's
m_pUnkOuter). But the COUtilityCar object contains a COCar object, so the
delegating ICar implementation delegates calls (through m_pICar) to
COCar's ICar implementation. Here is an example, ICar::Speed.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP COUtilityCar::CImpICar::Speed(
                 short nMph)
  {
    LOGF1(&quot;D: COUtilityCar::CImpICar::Speed. Delegating. nMph=%i.&quot;,nMph);

    m_pBackObj-&gt;m_pICar-&gt;Speed(nMph);

    return NOERROR;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
We need the m_pBackObj pointer to access the COUtilityCar object's m_pICar
pointer because this method is inside the delegating CImpICar class. Even
though this CImpICar class is a delegating interface implementation for
the one in the COCar object, we must still delegate calls to the IUnknown
of CImpICar using the interface's m_pUnkOuter. Doing so helps make the
COUtilityCar object itself an aggregatable COM object; just because it
contains a COCar object (to expose the ICar interface) doesn't mean it
cannot in turn be either contained or aggregated by some other COM object.
As we did for COCar, we code COUtilityCar to support either containment or
aggregation--a good general practice for all COM objects since it's easy
once you understand what's going on.

<P>
Now we can look at the COUtilityCar controlling IUnknown's QueryInterface
method:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP COUtilityCar::QueryInterface(
                 REFIID riid,
                 PPVOID ppv)
  {
    HRESULT hr = E_NOINTERFACE;
    *ppv = NULL;

    if (IID_IUnknown == riid)
    {
      *ppv = this;
      LOG(&quot;D: COUtilityCar::QueryInterface. 'this' pIUnknown returned&quot;);
    }
    else if (IID_ICar == riid)
    {
      *ppv = &amp;m_ImpICar;
      LOG(&quot;D: COUtilityCar::QueryInterface. pICar returned&quot;);
    }
    else if (IID_IUtility == riid)
    {
      *ppv = &amp;m_ImpIUtility;
      LOG(&quot;D: COUtilityCar::QueryInterface. pIUtility returned&quot;);
    }

    if (NULL != *ppv)
    {
      // We've handed out a pointer to the interface so obey the COM rules
      // and AddRef the reference count.
      ((LPUNKNOWN)*ppv)-&gt;AddRef();
      hr = NOERROR;
    }

    return (hr);
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
The IID_ICar case looks deceptively simple. QueryInterface just gives back
the address of the delegating ICar interface implementation
(&amp;m_ImpICar). The IID_IUtility case is indeed simple, since we have
implemented IUtility as a native interface on this COUtilityCar object.
QueryInterface gives back the address of that IUtility interface
(&amp;m_ImpIUtility).

<p>
The last point to make about COUtilityCar concerns its constructor. As
before, we use member initializers for the constructors of the nested
interface implementation classes. These are required because we are using
nested interface classes.

 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
With the COCruiseCar COM object class, once more the native interface,
ICruise, is implemented as a nested interface class. COCruiseCar exposes
the ICar interface through an aggregated COCar object. This is similar to
the way COUtilityCar exposes its own native IUtility interface and also
exposes the ICar interface, but COUtilityCar objects reuse the ICar
interface through containment, not aggregation, of a COCar object. In the
COMUSER code sample, we will build a COUtilityCruiseCar COM object that
aggregates this COCruiseCar object. We'll then have a COM object that
aggregates a COM object that aggregates a COM object.

<P>
CImpICruise itself has a private data member, m_pUnkOuter, for supporting
aggregation and delegation. This pointer is used to delegate calls to
IUnknown methods of the ICruise interface. If the COCruiseCar object is
not aggregated, calls are delegated to its IUnknown. If the COCruiseCar
object is aggregated, calls are delegated to the outermost controlling
IUnknown. The m_pBackObj is for use in any of the ICruise methods to
reference members of the COCruiseCar object.

<P>
As in previous interface implementations, the CImpICruise embedded class
needs to be made a friend class to COCruiseCar so that CImpICruise's
methods can access the private data in COCruiseCar.

<P>
COCruiseCar is itself constructed by aggregating the COCar COM object with
this object's native ICruise interface implementation. That is what the
m_pUnkCar pointer in the COCruiseCar object's private data is for. It
caches a pointer to the aggregated inner COCar object. This pointer is
used to delegate certain IUnknown calls to the inner object's IUnknown
interface. More on this later.

<P>
When COCruiseCar is aggregated in an outer composite COM object, it has an
m_pUnkOuter delegation pointer in its private data area. If it is not
aggregated, this pointer merely serves as a record of the NULL pUnkOuter
when a COCruiseCar object is created.

<P>
We will skip the COCruiseCar constructor function, because it is similar
to that of other COM functions we have already studied.

<P>
The CreateCruiseCar function discussed earlier in this tour calls the
COCruiseCar::Init method. Here is COCruiseCar::Init as it is implemented
in CRUCAR.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  HRESULT COCruiseCar::Init(void)
  {
    HRESULT hr;
    // Set up the right pIUnknown for delegation. If we are being
    // aggregated, then we pass the pUnkOuter in turn to any COM objects
    // that we are aggregating. m_pUnkOuter was set in the Constructor.
    IUnknown* pUnkOuter = (NULL == m_pUnkOuter) ? this : m_pUnkOuter;

    LOG(&quot;D: COCruiseCar::Init.&quot;);

    // We create an instance of the COCar object and do this via the
    // Aggregation reuse technique. Note we pass pUnkOuter as the
    // Aggregation pointer. It is the 'this' pointer to this present
    // COCruiseCar object if we are not being aggregated; otherwise it is
    // the pointer to the outermost object's controlling IUnknown.
    // Following the rules of Aggregation we ask CreateCar to give us an
    // IID_IUnknown interface. We cache this pointer to the IUnknown of
    // the new COCar COM object for later use in delegating IUnknown calls.
    hr = CreateCar(pUnkOuter, IID_IUnknown, (PPVOID)&amp;m_pUnkCar);

    return (hr);
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The CreateCar function creates and aggregates a COCar object and asks that
the controlling IUnknown of the new COCar object be placed in the
m_pUnkCar pointer discussed above.

<P>
This Init functionality could be attempted in the constructor function,
but aggregation requests in the constructor can cause problems that are
difficult to debug. Depending on the order of events, such creation calls
often cause QueryInterface calls that are delegated to the outermost
aggregating object. At that point, the source of any errors encountered
can be difficult to detect. Placing aggregation requests in a separate
Init method can make it easier to avoid problems, or to detect them if
they arise. It is also convenient to make the Init method a member of the
COCruiseCar class (rather than putting it in the CreateCruiseCar function)
because the method has access to the object's private data and to the
'this' pointer. For example, in Init's conditional assignment of pUnkOuter
above, we use both m_pUnkOuter and the 'this' pointer.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  IUnknown* pUnkOuter = (NULL == m_pUnkOuter) ? this : m_pUnkOuter;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This conditional assignment gives pUnkOuter the right value for the
CreateCar aggregation creation call. It's part of what is needed to make
the COCruiseCar COM object an aggregating object that is at the same time
aggregatable itself.

<P>
If m_pUnkOuter is NULL, this COCruiseCar object itself is not being
aggregated. If it is not being aggregated, the inner COCar object still
needs to be created as an aggregated object. In this case, COCruiseCar's
'this' controlling IUnknown pointer is passed in as the outermost
controlling IUnknown. By doing so, any aggregated inner objects are
informed that this COCruiseCar object is the outermost controlling
IUnknown.

<P>
If m_pUnkOuter is not NULL, the COCruiseCar object is itself being
aggregated, and it passes to any aggregated inner objects the pointer it
receives in m_pUnkOuter as the outermost controlling IUnknown.

<P>
We mentioned earlier that m_pUnkCar was used to delegate certain IUnknown
calls to the aggregated inner object. One place to see this delegation in
action is in COCruiseCar::QueryInterface.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP COCruiseCar::QueryInterface(
                 REFIID riid,
                 PPVOID ppv)

    HRESULT hr = E_NOINTERFACE;
    *ppv = NULL;

    if (IID_IUnknown == riid)

      // This ICruise interface is implemented in this COCruiseCar object
      // and might be called a native interface of COCruiseCar.
      *ppv = &amp;m_ImpICruise;
      LOG(&quot;D: COCruiseCar::QueryInterface. pICruise returned.&quot;);
    }

    if (NULL != *ppv)
    {
      // We've handed out a pointer to an interface, so obey the COM rules
      // and AddRef its reference count.
      ((LPUNKNOWN)*ppv)-&gt;AddRef();
      hr = NOERROR;
    }
    else if (IID_ICar == riid)
    {
      LOG(&quot;D: COCruiseCar::QueryInterface. ICar delegating.&quot;);
      // We didn't implement the ICar interface in this COCruiseCar object.
      // The aggregated inner object (COCar) is contributing the ICar
      // interface to this present composite or aggregating COCruiseCar
      // object. So, to satisfy a QI request for the ICar interface,
      // we delegate the QueryInterface to the inner object's controlling
      // IUnknown.
      hr = m_pUnkCar-&gt;QueryInterface(riid, ppv);
    }

    return (hr);
  }

<P>
The IID_IUnknown and IID_ICruise cases are familiar. If QueryInterface
passes those pointers by request, it must call AddRef on their interface.
The IID_ICruise interface is exposed as a native interface and is
implemented in the COCruiseCar class, so it is easy to pass a pointer to
it. For the IID_ICar interface, however, the request must be passed to the
aggregated object that owns it. The cached object pointer m_pUnkCar is
used to delegate the QueryInterface call to the inner COCar object, which
will delegate the call to its outermost controlling IUnknown, the present
COCruiseCar object.

<P>
For information on the COCruiseCar::Release method, see the code comments
below.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP_(ULONG) COCruiseCar::Release(void)
  {
    ULONG ulCount = --m_cRefs;

    LOGF1(&quot;D: COCruiseCar::Release. New cRefs=%i.&quot;, m_cRefs);

    if (0 == m_cRefs)
    {
      // We artificially bump the main ref count. This fulfills one of
      // the rules of aggregated objects and ensures that an indirect
      // recursive call to this release won't occur because of other
      // delegating releases that might happen in our own destructor.
      m_cRefs++;
      delete this;
    }

    return ulCount;
  }

<p>
The COCruiseCar::CImpICruise::CImpICruise constructor uses the following
logic to assign its own IUnknown delegation pointer.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  if (NULL == pUnkOuter)
  {
    m_pUnkOuter = pBackObj;
    LOG(&quot;D: COCruiseCar::CImpICruise Constructor. Non-Aggregating.&quot;);
  }
  else
  {
    m_pUnkOuter = pUnkOuter;
    LOG(&quot;D: COCruiseCar::CImpICruise Constructor. Aggregating.&quot;);
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
If the COCruiseCar object is aggregated, the ICruise interface's
m_pUnkOuter delegation pointer is assigned the pointer to the outermost
controlling IUnknown (constructor parameter pUnkOuter). If the COCruiseCar
object is not aggregated, any IUnknown calls received by the ICruise
interface are delegated to the IUnknown of the COCruiseCar object using
the value of pBackObj. The pBackObj pointer is passed to the CImpICruise
constructor as the COCruiseCar object's 'this' pointer. This parameter to
the interface implementation constructor was achieved through the use of
member initializers in COCruiseCar's constructor. For more details on this
special use of member initializers, see the discussion of the
COCruiseCar::Init method earlier in this text file.

<P>
The CImpICruise interface's IUnknown methods are simple outward
delegations using the value of m_pUnkOuter assigned. This assignment of
the m_pUnkOuter IUnknown pointer in the CImpICruise constructor requires
no call to AddRef, because the CImpICruise lifetime is guaranteed by the
lifetime of the parent object in which CImpICruise is nested. This
convenience is one of the benefits of nested interface class
implementations.
