CLIENT.EXE demonstrates how a client uses the DDEML library.

CLOCK.EXE uses Request or Advise transactions to get the time or the Poke 
transaction to change the time.

DDEMO.EXE demonstrates how to use lists of conversations, how to handle 
links, how to handle simple asynchronous transactions, and how to use your 
own custom formats.

INSTALL.EXE uses DDEML to add groups and items to the Program Manager.

PHTEST.EXE uses PROGHELP.DLL, a simple DDEML service DLL.
