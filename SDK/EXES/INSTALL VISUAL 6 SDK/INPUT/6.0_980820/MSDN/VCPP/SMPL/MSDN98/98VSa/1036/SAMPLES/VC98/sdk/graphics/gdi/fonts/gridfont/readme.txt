Displaying Font Codepoints


The GRIDFONT sample, written in C++, displays a grid containing Unicode
codepoints. The user is able to select a font, and then see which codepoints
are covered by the font.

Note: There is a font distributed with the Win32 SDK which covers more than 
one thousand Unicode characters. In order to use this application to its 
full potential, you will want to install that font by using Fonts in the 
Control Panel. The font is named l_10646.TTF.
