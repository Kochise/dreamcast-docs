LOCSERVE - Local Server


SUMMARY
=======

The LOCSERVE sample begins with the car-related COM Objects of the previous
DLLSERVE sample and rehouses them in an out-of-process local server,
LOCSERVE.EXE. To do so requires little change to the COM objects themselves
(COCar, COUtilityCar, and COCruiseCar). This sample introduces the new
facilities to house them in a out-of-process COM server, including class
factories for each component.

This out-of-process server provides the following components: LocCar,
LocUtilityCar, and LocCruiseCar.

In the series of COM tutorial code samples, LOCSERVE works with the
LOCCLIEN code sample to illustrate LOCSERVE's out-of-process local server
facilities for creating components that can be used by an EXE client and
the subsequent manipulation of those components by LOCCLIEN.EXE.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of LOCSERVE, see the
Code Tour section in LOCSERVE.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of LOCSERVE, see the Usage section in LOCSERVE.HTM. To
read LOCSERVE.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the LOCSERVE lesson in the table of lessons. You can also achieve
the same thing by clicking the LOCSERVE.HTM file after locating the main
tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also LOCCLIEN.HTM in the
main tutorial directory for more details on the LOCCLIEN client
application and how it works with LOCSERVE.EXE itself. You must build
LOCSERVE.EXE before building or running LOCCLIEN. LOCSERVE's makefile
automatically registers LOCSERVE's components in the registry. These
components must be registered before LOCSERVE is available to outside COM
clients as a server for those components. This registration is done using
the REGISTER.EXE utility built in the earlier REGISTER lesson. To build or
run LOCSERVE, you should build the REGISTER code sample first.

As an out-of-process local server, LOCSERVE relies on standard marshaling
for clients to use its interfaces across process boundaries. Such standard
marshaling for the interfaces used in LOCSERVE's COM objects is provided
in the MARSHAL.DLL server built in the previous lesson. To build or run
LOCSERVE, you should build the MARSHAL code sample first.

For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

Usage
-----

LOCSERVE is an application that is meant to be used as an out-of-process COM
server. Out-of-process servers like LOCSERVE are registered in the system
registry, and LOCSERVE has built-in support for registering its components.
It accepts the following command line switches to register and unregister:

    -RegServer or /RegServer to register
    -UnregServer or /UnregServer to unregister

String matches on these switches are case-insensitive. As an out-of-process
server, LOCSERVE also recognizes the standard -Embedding or /Embedding
switch, which directs it to run as such a server. In this sample, that means
LOCSERVE will run hidden. If you attempt to run LOCSERVE as a stand-alone
application, it will exit with an error. You can manually direct LOCSERVE to
run visible by starting it with an explicit -Embedding switch on its command
line prior to running the LOCCLIEN client.

The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the LOCSERVE directory:

  nmake register

You can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the LOCSERVE directory.

  ..\register\register.exe locserve.exe

These registration commands require a prior build of the REGISTER sample
in this series, as well as a prior build of LOCSERVE.EXE.
