 | |                         |Untouched disk image requires a very large     |
 | |                         |size of file.                                  |
 | |                         |This format ensures the stablest writing.      |

 |                           |Size of this file is the smallest.             |
 |                           |The load during writing is slightly higher     |
 |                           |than with other writing methods.               |
 +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+


3.2.2 Specification of extent placement
For GD-ROM drive, disk periphery enables rapid access.
CD CRAFT can construct disk layout responding to access speed by its file 
placement function.
The following script command controls file placement on disk.

    ExtentLocation : specifying location of the whole data area
                     (location on inner and outer circumferences of disk)
    Location       : specifying location of file unit
                     (specifying location priority)

When extent location is set to periphery, programs and/or data are located 
on disk periphery.  If extent area is too small, dummy sector is used to hold data.  
You should know that data are written in every memory area of GD-R disk.

<Remark>
Default for image creation are set as follows;
  File format     : disk imageÅ|compact image format
  Extent location : locating file on disk periphery


4. Setup
4.1 Setup
This section shows CD CRAFT setup procedures.
Refer to SCSI card manual for SCSI card setup and installation of ASPI manager.

(1) Setup of console version
  (a) Copy DLL file "msvcrt.dll" to Windows system directory (\windows\system).
  (b) Copy console version program "crfgdc.exe" to installed directory.

(2) Setup of GUI version
  (a) Copy DLL file "msvcrt.dll""mfc42.dll to Windows system directory (\windows\
      system).
  (b) Copy GUI version program "crfgd.exe" and help file "crfgd.hlp""crfgd.cnt" 
      to installed directory.
    * Creating short cut for "crfgd.exe" is recommended.

4.2 Handling GD-R
GD-R disk writing performs subtle processing technique.
Exercise utmost care when handling drives and media.

(1) Drive installation
  Install drive on the stable surface which is not affected by vibration.
  Do not put harddisk, etc. on GD Writer drive enclosure.

(2) Handling disk
  In writing GD-R disk, use a blower to blow away dust on media.


4.3 System Set Up 
It is needed to set up system for Windows in order to operate GD Writer drive properly. 
System is set up through "system" on "control panel".
Setting contents vary depending on how the GD Writer is recognized by the system.

(1) If the GD Writer is recognized as an unknown device:
  Device type of GD-R drive is 'WORM', which is normally recognized as "unknown 
  device" by system. In this case, there are no settings to be made in 
  particular.

(2) If the GD Writer is recognized as CD-ROM:
  If device type conversion driver, attached to a commercial CD-R writing 
  software, is embedded, device type changes to "CD-ROM" to be recognized as 
  CD-ROM in system.
  (Using Explorer, confirm that a new CD-ROM has been registered.)
  In this event, the following system set up is required.

• "automatic insertion"
Windows always checks disk insertion into CD-ROM drive.
Operation of this function may cause writing failure on disk.
This failure can be controlled by CD-ROM device property "automatic insertion".  
Set this function OFF.

• "disconnect"
When carrying out processing which takes an appreciable time, temporarily disconnect 
from the SCSI bus, allowing it to be used by other devices. When the command completes, 
reconnect to the bus. This function improves through put of bus as a whole.
The default value for this setting is "ON." You must not change this setting to ensure 
device's proper operation.

<Set Up Procedures>
(1) Select "system" on "control panel".
(2) Select "device manager" tab.
(3) Select the connecting GD-Writer from "CD-ROM" list.
(4) Select "property" tab to set "option", as shown below.
    "automatic insertion" : OFF     ;Change setting.
    "disconnect"          : ON      ;Check ON.
(5) Start up the system again to activate the setting.
  * Turn power switches of the main unit and the GD-Writer off, then on again.


4.4 Notes on Operating Environment
As GD-R disk writing requires intricate processing technique, it's necessary 
to keep the instruments from vibration to implement system performance.
Because the system environment has been substantially altered, it is recommended 
to check that the system performance is fully satisfactory by conducting a test 
writing when CD CRAFT is used for the first time.
If an error occurs during writing, take the following preventive steps.

(1) Confirm the settings "automatic insertion = OFF" and "disconnect = ON".
(2) You must not connect to network system. (Especially NetWare's load is high.) 
(3) Work in MS-DOS full-screen mode.
(4) Stop other applications.
(5) Stop the program operating in the background.
    (screen saver, system agent, etc).
(6) Set Power Management to OFF.
(7) Improve hard disk fragmentation. (Execution of de-fragmentation) 
(8) Connect GD-Writer only, disconnecting as many SCSI instruments as possible.
(9) Check the length of the SCSI cable. (Max. length of cable is 6 m in the case 
    of the SCSI-2 standard.)
(10) Pay attention to the SCSI ID setting and condition of terminator connection.
(11) Uninstall other CD-R writing software.
     If multiple CD-R writing softwares are installed, system operation will be 
     unstable.
(12) Check that the SCSI card resources (IRQ, DMA, etc.) are not conflicting 
     with other devices.


5. Start Up Procedures
Run the following program.  For console version, type a program name from command 
lines displayed on MS-DOS prompt screen.

6. Subcommands
This section describes subcommands which specify process description and operating conditions.


6.1 Specification of subcommand
There are two ways to specify subcommand; command line specification and subcommand 
file specification.

(1) Command line specification
  Subcommand is directly specified from command lines.  Commands are 
  interpreted in order from the first.

    crfgdc -subcommand 1=argument 1, argument 2 - subcommand 2=argument 1, 
    argument 2,...

(2) Subcommand file specification
  Subcommand is specified by subcommand file instead of command lines.

    crfgdc -sub= subcommand file name

<Remarks>
Subcommand can be specified by either program of console version or GUI version.

            %d     : specified number (decimal number) 

[Function]  Operating environment is set to create image file.
            Table 6.1 shows the range of parameters requiring specified numbers.

(1) i
  Maximum number of ISO files (files put on GD to be created) is setl

(2) d
  Maximum number of source (original files for ISO files) is set.

(3) c
  Size of the character string area which stores character strings used for 
  CD script files is set.  ISO file names, directory names, file source names,
  macro definitions, and script command arguments are stored in the character
  string area.

(4) dsda
  When accessing the high density area, the single density area should also be
  written.  In order to debug a program in the high density area, dummy track 
  is crated in the single density area (track 1:MODE1, track 2:CDDA). Image
  file is composed of the single density area consisting of dummy track and 
  the high density area specified by CD scripts.
  This parameter is only valid for the console version.

     | imf0      |compact image format (default)       |
     +-----------+-------------------------------------+
     | imf1      |full image format                    |
     +-----------+-------------------------------------+
  File format of disk image is specified.
  Disk image file has "full image format" which includes all sector data and 
  "compact image format" whose file does not include redundancy such as gap 
  area.  File size of compact image format is smaller than that of full image
  format.

(6) extloc
     +-----------+-------------------------------------+
     | extloc0   |located on disk prephery (default)   |
     +-----------+-------------------------------------+
     | extloc1   |located on the internal              |
     |           |circumference of disk                |
     +-----------+-------------------------------------+
  Extent location on disk is specified.  This parameter is active only for the
  high dencity area(extent: continuous data sector string on disk).
  When locating extent on disk peripheral (extloc0), block managing 
  the wholedisk such as PVD area is first located.  Then dummy sector is 
  inserted to locate the following CD-DA track/data track on disk peripheral.
  When locating extent on the internal circumference of disk (extloc1), files
  are located as specified by CD script.  In this case, dummy sector is not in
  serted.

(7) nalfrf
  In the case of peripheral location, the first read file is automatically
  located in the outermost track of the disk regardless of the description in
  the script.
  When this parameter is specified, the self-locating function of the first
  read file is disabled.
  In the case of location on the internal circumference of the disk, the
  self-locating function of the first read file does not work.

            mltw   :Set multi-write mode
            
            %d     : parameter (decimal)
[Function]  Sets the operating environment for when the image file is written to disk.

(1) test
  If the test mode write completes successfully, ask for confirmation before 
  continuing with the actual write processing.
  * It is not possible to specify test and testgo simultaneously.

(2) testgo
  If the test mode write completes successfully, continue with the actual write 
  processing without asking for confirmation.
  * It is not possible to specify test and testgo simultaneously.

(3) rmv
  Delete the image file after the writing to disk completes.
  The parameter value determines the type of image file deleted, and in the 
  current version only CIM files are supported. The value must therefore always
  be 1.

(4) dsda
  Writes the minimum data as a dummy track in the single-density area.
  The image file specified by the wm subcommand is written in the high-density 
  area. This parameter can be used to skip preparation of a script and data 
  for the single-density area when you only wish to debug a program in the 
  high-density area.
  * This parameter is only valid for the console version.

(5) noej
  Ensures that the disk is not ejected automatically after writing is completed.
  * Under the default setting, the disk is ejected automatically after writing 
    is completed.

(6) mltw
  Sets to multi-write mode.  It can control GD-Writer under the condition that 
  the GD-Writer power is on and a GD-R disk is set.  This function is valid 
  only on console version.

                                              writing.


9. Precautions for CD creation
9.1 Precautions for creating self-starting disk
When creating a self-starting disk in the device, all the following items must 
be satisfied.

  (a) A special IP must be located in each system area for single-density and 
      high-density use.
    For the time being, if you want to try creating a self-starting test disk, 
    use the following all-purpose IPs provided in Dreamcast SDK.

      ip0000.bin: IP for single-density
      ip.bin:     IP for high-density

    In these IPs, the first read file is named as "1st_read.bin".

  (b) The first read file should be located at the outermost track of the 
    high-density area. The last track must therefore be a Mode1 track.
    Please refer to the sample script "gdsample.scr" provided with this tool.
    (From CD CRAFT Ver. 2.27, a function for self-locating the first read file 
    in the outermost track is provided.)

  (c) The leading character of the name of the first read file must be a numeral 
     (0 to 9), and the filename must conform to the 8.3 name format.  Also, when listing 
     files in alphabetical order, only "0gdtex.pvr" (texture for disk label)can be 
     existed as a preceding file.

<Note>
The above items are the minimum required items when creating a disk capable of 
self-starting. This is no guarantee that this can be the master release.
Do not fail to check the following items when the master is delivered.

  (a) Items specified in the IP
  • Product code
  • Application maker ID
  • Corresponding area code, ... etc.

  (b) The following PVD definition contents and compatibility with the actual 
      file
    Identification data and actual file should be defined for the disk's 
    single-density area.
  • Copyright file identification data
  • Abstract file identification data
  • Bibliographic file identification data


9.2 Copyright file definition
In the root directory of the single-density area of the GD-ROM, define the copyright file, 
abstract file and bibliographic file using the specified 
filenames.

 +---------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------+
 |    File       |  Filename   |               Description                   |
 +---------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------+
 |Copyright file |COPYRIGH.TXT |Describes the copyright information.         |
 |               |             |When specifying the copyright file using the |
 |               |             |script, use the CopyrightFileIdentifier      |
 |               |             |command.                                     |
 +---------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------+
 |Abstract file  |ABSTRACT.TXT |Gives and abstract of the application.       |
 |               |             |When specifying the abstract file using the  |
 |               |             |script, use the AbstractFileIdentifier       |
 |               |             |command.                                     |
 +---------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------+
 |Bibliographic  |BIBLIOGR.TXT |Describes reference document information.    |
 |file           |             |When specifying the bibliographic file using |
 |               |             |the script, use the                          |
 |               |             |BibliographicFileIdentifier command.         |
 +---------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------+


9.3 General file definition
(1) Filename rules
  The names of files defined on the GD-ROM should conform to the "ISO9660 
  Level 2" protocol.

  (a) The filename may consist of up to 30 characters. (Period not included.)
  (b) The directory name may consist of up to 31 characters.
  (c) D letters (upper case Roman letters, numerals, underbar) can be used for 
     the names.

  * ISO9660 Level 2 is set as default for CD CRAFT.
    This can be changed by using the script command "FileNameType".

(2) Distinguishing the first read file
  Because it is necessary to distinguish between general files and the first 
  read file, further conditions have been attached to the naming of filenames 
  for general files.

  (a) Filenames and directory names must start with a Roman letter.

  If this condition is not met, the disk will not be able to start.


9.4 CD-DA track creation
9.4.1 CD-DA data
(1) CD-DA data format
  The CD-DA data to be registered on the CD-DA track should be quantized 16-bit 
  stereo type PCM data with a sampling frequency of 44.1 KHz.
  The data should be arranged in the Intel format (little endian) as shown in 
  the following figure.

    D7  D0 D15  D8
     +-----+-----+
     |LSB  |MSB  |
     +-----+-----+
     |      Å^
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----------+-----+-----+
     | L1  | R1  | L2  | R2  |ÅEÅEÅEÅEÅE | Ln  | Rn  |
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----------+-----+-----+

(2) Special processing of silent data
  Due to restrictions on reading of CD-DA track data from the GD-ROM drive, 
  problems can arise if silence continues at the beginning of the CD-DA track.
  To cope with this problem, the CD CRAFT checks whether the beginning of the 
  CD-DA track consists of silence (0x0000). If there is silence at beginning, 
  it is replaced by absolute lowest volume data (0xFFFF).


9.4.2 Index
KATANA does not support playback of the CD-DA track index.
This means that the index number cannot be set at 2 or higher.
Therefore, an error is generated if multiple file sources are specified by the CD-DA track.


10.  Multi-Write Function
CD CRAFT console version supports multi-write function, which can write multiple GD-Rs 
simultaneously.  With this function, actual writing time can be eliminated.

10.1  Multi-write operating environment
(1) Hardware
  To ensure a stable write, a machine with high spec is preferrable.  Also, the following 
  conditions must be met:
  (a) GD Writer
  • Up to 2 GD Writers can be connected to 1 SCSI card.  Therefore, using 2 peices of 
  SCSI card makes it possible to write 4 GD-Rs simultaneously at most.
  (it may depend on working environment or conditions)
  • The firmware version of the writers must be the same.
  (b) SCSI Card
  • Adaptec SCSI card AHA-2940 series only
  (AHA-2940/AHA-2940U/AHA-2940AU/AHA-2940UW)
  • SCSI card should be identical if 2 peices are used
  (c) Hard Disk Drive
  • Use of IDE hard disk is recommended. (to reduce SCSI bus load)

(2) System Settings
  Reconfirm that "auto insert =OFF" and "disconnect =ON"

10.2  Multi-write procedures
(1) Program execution condition
  The following conditions must be fulfilled upon execution:
   (a) MS-DOS full screen mode
   (b) Not to connect to network
   (c) Not to run any background jobs such as a screen saver
(2) Select of GD-Writer
  It controls GD-Writers if the power is on and GD-R is set.
(3) Command format
  ex.  crfgdc -mcd=sample.scr -wenv=mltw
  (create an image file and perform multi-write)
(4) Others
    (a) Writing in disc image style is recommended
    (b) If an error occurs, it stops processing only for the applied drive.
    Rest of the drives keep processing.

 +-+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 |fb30 : The first-read file is not on the most outside edge of the disc     |
 | +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 | |Reason |The first read file is not located in the outmost track.         |
 | |       |Or it is located beyond the defined periphery.                   |
 | +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 | |Remedy |Build so that the image file is located in the outermost track.  |
 | |       |                                                                 |
 +-+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 |fb31 : The first-read file is not in the last trac of the disc             |
 | +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 | |Reason |The first read file is not defined in the last track.            |

 | +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 | |Remedy |Define the first read file in the root directory of the          |
 | |       |high-density area using the specified filename.                  |
 +-+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 |fb33 : The first-read file name is not correct                             |
 | +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 | |Reason |The filename of the first read file is not correct.              |
 | |       |The first character must be a numeral (0 to 9), and the filename |
 | |       |must conform to the 8.3 name format.                             |
 | +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 | |Remedy |System ID should be created again.                               |
 | |       |Revise the script.                                               |

 | +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 | |Remedy |Define the filename of the first read file.                      |
 | |       |                                                                 |
 +-+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 |fb35 : Some files precede the first-read file in directory order           |
 | +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 | |Reason |In addition to the first read file, another file or directory    |
 | |       |whose filename starts with a numeral has been defined.           |
 | +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
 | |Remedy |Start the filename with a Roman letter except in the case of the |
 | |       |first read file.                                                 |
 | |       |For details on the first read file conditions, refer to the IP   |
 | |       |related documentation provided with Dreamcast_SDK.               |
