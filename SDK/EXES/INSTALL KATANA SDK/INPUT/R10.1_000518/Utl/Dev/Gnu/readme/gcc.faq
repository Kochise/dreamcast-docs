Info file by: Toshiyasu Morita
 Last update: 11/5/99 @ 4:48 pm

Note: The gcc change log has been split out into a separate file called
      "gcc.log". There is now a change log for this faq called "faq.log"
      as well.

--------------
Reporting bugs
--------------

Please make sure your bug actually exists, since we've had a spate of
subsequently disproven bug reports, and each release of GCC is
sanity checked. (We run it through c-torture and recompile DOOM 32x.)

When sending bug reports, please send:

1) The smallest C source fragment that will reproduce the bug, preferably
   already preprocessed, (using the -E -P switches)

   *** This MUST be a standalone compilable sample.  ***
   *** Sending the function without any datatype     ***
   *** definitions is not very helpful. The sample   ***
   *** should NOT be dependent on any include files. ***

2) The resultant erroneous output code with a few comments indicating
   the offending code, and why it is incorrect (See "Generating mixed
   C/assembly listings" for instructions on producing mixed listings),

3) The *exact* compiler switch(es) used to compile the example,

4) The compiler version - the compiler version and Sega release date.
   Be sure to verify the correct version by typing "gcc -v".

Please send the above to:

SOA Developer Technical Support hotline: 415/701-4060 or dts@sega.com

-------------------
Install directions:
-------------------

1) Save the previous version of the compiler

   Sometimes when changes are made to fix bugs in gcc the modifications
   will create new bugs - so be sure to save your previous version!

2) If you are running Win95 OSR2 then install the OSR2.1 update, otherwise
   known as the "USB update". If you do not install the OSR2.1 update,
   then the GNU tools may crash when you hit ctrl-C to abort compilation!

   The "USB update" file is available from links at:

   http://www.compuclinic.com/osr2faq/index.html

3) Unzip the compiler zipfile using Winzip.

4) Edit the SETENV.BAT file in the compiler directory.

   Set the CYGROOT environment variable to the top-level compiler directory.
   The SETENV.BAT file assumes you unzipped to C:\GNUTOOLS - if you unzipped
   to a different directory, be sure to edit this file.

5) Run the SETENV.BAT file

6) Your compiler should be installed - type "gcc" and it should say:

   gcc.exe: No input files

7) We have some reports that some antivirus programs (Norton Antivirus)
   slow down compilation time tremendously. If you notice your compile times
   are rather slow, you might try disabling your antivirus software.

8) Be sure to recompile all of your source files. The code between different
   versions may not be compatible; the most notable was an object file format
   change during 9/94. If you mix object files from different versions
   it's likely your code will fail.

9) PDF files of the documentation are in the "info" subdirectory.

Helpful tips and tricks - using GCC and G++
-------------------------------------------

=> Use struct copies (instead of copying individual elements of a struct).

   GCC and G++ generate code with weak scheduling when copying a struct
   by individual elements.

   GCC and G++ generate code with better instruction scheduling when
   copying a struct via struct assignment.

=> Use C++ "inline" methods sparingly

   Many people overuse the C++ "inline" facility because it eliminates
   a function call and therefore "always makes code faster".

   This isn't necessarily true.

   When a C++ method which requires many registers is inlined into
   another function which uses many registers, this creates a code block
   which requires an extremely large number of registers. This can 
   overload G++'s register allocator, and force it to generate many register
   spills/restores to/from the stack frame (e.g. generate slow code).

   If the two functions were compiled separately, then GCC could probably
   generate more efficient code for both functions.

   Good C++ methods for inlining are usually:
   
     o Small

       Small functions are good for inlining because the cost of the
       function call is fairly large compared to the work performed.
       Large functions are usually not worth inlining because the cost
       of the function call is small compared to the actual work performed.

     o Use only a few variables (registers)

       So you don't overload the register allocator, as described above.

=> I see an "Out of memory" dialogue box when loading my executables
   into Codescape.

   Probably you have compiled for big-endian instead of little-endian...

=> Passing long command lines to GCC/AS/LD

   GCC supports the Microsoft convention of using "@filename" to pass
   long command lines. So, instead of invoking "gcc -option1 -option2 ..."
   you can put "-option1 -option2" into a file, and invoke "gcc @filename"
   instead.

=> Useful compiler options

   GCC supports three calling conventions on the SH4.
   These are:

   -m4

       FPU is assumed double-precision on function entry and exit.
       single = 32 bits, double = 64 bits.

   -m4-single

       FPU is assumed single-precision on function entry and exit.
       single = 32 bits, double = 64 bits.

   -m4-single-only

       FPU is always in single-precision mode.
       single = double = 32 bits. This mode is the fastest
       so we recommend using it over -m4 or -m4-single.

   A few other useful options:

   -Wall

      Turns on all warnings. This will detect uninitialized variables,
	  unused variables, etc. Generally a Good Thing.

   -ansi

      Turns on ANSI C compliance warnings. For strict ANSI compliance
	  (no GNU C extensions) use -pedantic instead (somewhat deprecated).

   -mrelax (C and C++, bigger win on C++)

      Inserts branch shortening hints for shortening at link time.
      Can convert some mova Lfoo, rn; jsr @rn; Lfoo .long func
      to bsr func which saves six bytes.

      Note: At source compile time, the -mrelax option must be used.
            At link time, if using gcc -mrelax must be used.
            If linking with ld, then -relax must be used.

      Note: As of this writing -mrelax does not update the debug info
            properly - it causes source lines not to line up properly
            with the disassembly. If this happens, please do not use.

   -mspace (C and C++)

       Requests GCC to minimize code size. Tells gcc not to unroll
       memory moves/struct copies and minimizes CSE movement.
       Usually extracts about a 5% penalty on code speed, but very useful
       when you're tight on memory.

       Note: Optimizing for space with -mspace disables inlining of __inline__
       functions! (for obvious reasons)

   -ffast-math (C and C++)

       Prevents GCC from generating calls to software sqrt, etc
       when -m4-single-only is used.

   -mdalign (C and C++)

       Preserves 64-bit alignment of the stack pointer. This allows
       hand-written assembly to use fmov.d to access doubles on the stack.

       Note: Neither libc nor libcross are fully compatible
             with this option, so great care will be needed
             when using this option.

   -mhitachi (C and C++)

        Uses the Hitachi C calling convention instead of the standard
        calling convention. The differences are:

        o GNU C will pass structures in registers if possible.
          Hitachi C always passes structures on the stack.

        o GNU C can pass some varargs parameters in registers.
          Hitachi C always passes all varargs parameters on the stack.

        o GNU C assumes MACL and MACH are clobbered across function calls.
          Hitachi C assumes MACL and MACH are preserved.

       Note: You must use the Hitachi C standard C libraries when using
             this option, because the GNU C libraries assume the standard
             calling convention.

       Note: You must properly prototype varargs/stdargs functions when
             using -mhitachi. Failure to prototype these functions will
             cause the callee to receive garbage data.

   -fstrict-aliasing

    This option will become available in early to mid '99 and improves
    alias analysis.

   -fargument-noalias
   -fargument-noalias-global (C and C++; bigger win for C++)

       (Roughly equivalent to "/Oa" on MSVC++)

       "-fargument-no alias" assumes arguments may not alias each other and
       "-fargument-noalias-global"  assumes arguments may not alias each other
		and globals.

	   This means if you have func(char *a, char *b) then gcc can assume
	   a will never point to the same data items as b, so when it writes
	   through pointer b, it doesn't need to flush registers loaded with
	   data from pointer a.

       G++ by default generates awful code for class variables;
       take this example:

typedef struct {
        float x, y, z;
} VERTEX;

class foo {

        public:
                VERTEX offset;
                void translate(VERTEX *vertex, int vertices_num);
};

void foo::translate(VERTEX *vertex, int vertices_num)

{
        int i;

        for (i=0; i<vertices_num; i++) {
                vertex[i].x += offset.x;
                vertex[i].y += offset.y;
                vertex[i].z += offset.z;
        }
}

    G++ compiles this at -O2 -m4-single-only to:

_translate__3fooP6VERTEXi:
        mov     #0,r3
        mov.l   r14,@-r15
        cmp/ge  r6,r3
        bt.s    L7
        mov     r15,r14
        mov     r4,r0
        mov     r4,r7
        add     #4,r0
        mov     r5,r2
        add     #8,r7
        mov     r5,r1
        add     #8,r2
        add     #4,r1
L5:
        fmov.s  @r5,fr1
        fmov.s  @r4,fr2		<- offset.x read every iteration
        fadd    fr2,fr1
        fmov.s  fr1,@r5
        fmov.s  @r1,fr1
        fmov.s  @r0,fr2		<- offset.y read every iteration
        fadd    fr2,fr1
        fmov.s  fr1,@r1
        fmov.s  @r2,fr1
        fmov.s  @r7,fr2		<- offset.z read every iteration
        fadd    fr2,fr1
        add     #1,r3
        add     #12,r5
        add     #12,r1
        fmov.s  fr1,@r2
        cmp/ge  r6,r3
        bf.s    L5
        add     #12,r2
L7:
        mov     r14,r15
        rts
        mov.l   @r15+,r14

    but when -O2 -m4-single-only -fargument-nolias is used:

_translate__3fooP6VERTEXi:
        mov     #0,r3
        mov.l   r14,@-r15
        cmp/ge  r6,r3
        bt.s    L7
        mov     r15,r14
        mov     r4,r1
        add     #8,r1
        fmov.s  @r1,fr2
        mov     r5,r2
        fmov.s  @r4+,fr4
        add     #8,r2
        mov     r5,r1
        fmov.s  @r4,fr3
        add     #4,r1
L5:
        fmov.s  @r5,fr1
        fadd    fr4,fr1		<- offset.x held in fr4
        fmov.s  fr1,@r5
        fmov.s  @r1,fr1
        fadd    fr3,fr1		<- offset.y held in fr3
        fmov.s  fr1,@r1
        fmov.s  @r2,fr1
        fadd    fr2,fr1		<- offset.z held in fr2
        add     #1,r3
        add     #12,r5
        add     #12,r1
        fmov.s  fr1,@r2
        cmp/ge  r6,r3
        bf.s    L5
        add     #12,r2
L7:
        mov     r14,r15
        rts
        mov.l   @r15+,r14

       This will make C++ code much faster, although care must be taken
       not to pass arguments pointers which could overlap.

   -fno-exceptions (C++ only)

       Tells GCC not to generate C++ exception-handling code.
       Using this option can reduce C++ code size.

   -fno-rtti (C++ only)

       Tells GCC not to generate C++ run-time type info.
       Using this option can reduce C++ code size.

   -fomit-frame-pointer

       Allows the compiler to use r14 as a general purpose register.
       Since the source-level debugger expects to locate local variables
       by using r14, this may cause problems when attempting to source-level
       debug. Do not use this compiler option when debugging code.

   -fwritable-strings

       GCC normally places read-only strings in the .text section.
       Specifying this option will place strings into the .data section
       instead of the .text section.

   -nostdlib

       Prevents gcc from linking libraries containing the standard C library
	   if you're not using them.

   -g
      
       Outputs debugging information.

   -gdwarf+

       Outputs DWARF 1.2 format debugging information with gdb extensions
       (works with Codescape). Only applicable when using the ELF version
       of the toolset.

   -fno-schedule-insns2

       Disables instruction scheduling. This makes debugging easier because
       the source code pointer will not jump around semi-randomly when
       single-stepping through source. This does make code slower, though.

   -ffunction-sections

        Places each function in a separate section. This allows the linker
        to remove unused functions when linked with --gc-sections (or 
        -Wl,--gc-sections when using gcc to link).

        This is particularly useful for C++ projects where redundant
        constructors and destructors for each file.

        o Note: This is a new feature and may not exist in this version
          of the toolset.

   (Please see caution notes on -fargument-noalias-global)

=> Viewing gcc phase execution

   If you'd like to see the commands gcc passes to cpp, as and ld, then
   pass the "-v" option to gcc.

=> Can't redirect compiler errors to a file.

   The compiler outputs the errors to stderr - you can redirect stderr
   under Windows NT with "2>" like this: "gcc .... 2> errors.txt"

   Under Windows 95/98 the stderr is not redirectable.

=> Long command lines

   GCC supports "command files" - you can use "gcc @filename" and
   GCC will fetch its command line options from the specified
   filename.

=> Generating mixed C/assembly listings

   To generate a nice assembly listing with interspersed C source, try:

   gcc -O2 -m2 -g -S foo.c
   as -ahld foo.s > foo.lst

   "foo.lst" will now contain a nicely formatted mixed C/assembly listing.

   Sometimes the previous method does not work well, and generating
   an assembly listing from the object file is better. Copy the source
   file to the same directory as the object file, then do:

   objdump --disassemble --source foo.o > foo.lst

=> Linking in general - C or assembly

   It is much better to use gcc to link, and use "-Xlinker option"
   to pass options to the linker, than to use ld itself to link.

   There are at least two reasons:

   1) If ld is used to link, then the library paths must be specified
      explicitly. This is a problem because when gcc is upgraded,
      the makefile will need to be changed as well to use the new libraries.
      If this is not done. then the makefile will use the new gcc with
      the old libraries, which can cause problems.

   2) When linking using gcc, gcc will automatically set the ld parameters
      so ld will search the SH4 libraries before the SH1 libraries if
      -m4(-single, -single-only) is specified. If ld is used directly,
      then the SH4 libraries must be specified manually in the correct order
      relative to the SH1 libraries.

=> Linker cannot find symbols which are in your library files.

   The linker only makes one pass through your libraries, so if you have
   two libraries which are dependent on each other you must mention the first
   library, then the second library, then the first library again.

   It is possible to create pathological cases where the linker cannot
   link your libraries. In such a case, you probably want to merge the
   offending libraries into one single library.

   For reference, the default link order is:

   Without floating point math: -lgcc -lc -lgcc
   With    floating point math: -lm -lgcc -lc -lgcc

=> Linker cannot find symbols in your application

   If you are programming in C++ and calling C functions, did you remember
   to prototype your C functions and wrap the prototypes in extern "C"?
   Failure to do this will cause the C function names to be C++ mangled,
   and the linker will not be able to find your C functions.

=> Anonymous unions in C files

   Anonymous unions are not a part of the ANSI C (X3J11) standard; they
   are a C++ feature implemented by some C compilers, but not by gcc.

=> Standard C library floating point functions

   If you use standard C library floating point functions, then you must link
   with the floating point library (libm.a) by specifying:

   gcc <filename.c> -lm

   The "-lm" MUST be after the filename, not before.

=> Undefined reference to 'pow'/'sin'/'cos' (transcendental functions)

   Most of the math library is in libm.a, so when you link using the
   gcc library, specify "-lm".

=> GCC complains about "garbage at end of number".

   You probably wrote something like "0x1800E+OFFSET". GCC interprets this
   as a floating pointer number because of "0E+OFFSET" looks like a floating
   point number.

   The solution is to place a space between "E" and "+".

=> Parallel makes

   If you have a dual processor Windows NT box, try "make -j4", or if you
   have a top-level makfile which spawns makes in subdirectories, try
   "make MAKE="make -j4"" ... this will start four compilers compiling
   in parallel. Very nifty!

=> Linker is slow.

   We have heard various reports that linking to a RAMdisk accelerates
   the link process by a factor of 5 or 6.

   Also, if you are using Windows NT Workstation, the following may help:

   By defailt, Windows NT Workstation has "Large System Cache" disabled.
   This means that Windows NT Workstation only uses 4 mb of memory for
   a disk cache, which is fairly weak. If you enable "Large System Cache"
   then Windows NT Workstation will use all free memory as a disk cache
   which should improve performance of disk-intensive operations.
 
   To enable the "Large System Cache" run regedt32.exe, then edit the
   registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\
   Session Manager\Memory Management. You will see a registry entry
   labeled "LargeSystemCache". Double click on this and change this to "1".
   Reboot the machine to implement the change.

Helpful tips and tricks - programming with GCC and G++
------------------------------------------------------

=> Link errors occur when linking stating that constructors and
   virtual tables are undefined.

   Cause:
       The first virtual function declaration in the class is never defined in 
       any of your source modules. Therefore, the virtual table/ctor/dtor
       definitions are never emitted.

   Solution:
       Make sure there exists a definition for all virtual functions
       declared in the header file - especially the first one declared
       (and not defined in the class declaration) - even if the functions
       are never used.

=> BSS must be cleared and stack (r15) must be set.

   The standard initialization code in crt0.o will set clear your BSS
   and gcc will automagically generate a call to ___main in your main()
   function which will call your global constructors for you.

   If you choose not to use crt0.o, you must clear your own BSS.
   If you choose not to call your main function "main()" then you
   will need to call your global constructors manually.

   Variables such as "int foo = 0;" will be placed in your BSS, and if
   your BSS isn't cleared, then (obviously) foo may have a nonzero value.

   The default stack in crt0.o is eight bytes - be sure to set up
   your own stack if you plan to do anything at all.

=> Use signed char/short/ints wherever possible.

   The SH4 automagically sign-extends when loading chars and shorts;
   so to use unsigned chars and shorts it must zero out the upper bits
   after loading. This is inefficient.

   Also, float-to-signed-int conversion is one instruction, but
   float-to-unsigned int requires a library call.

=> Access to hardware registers is faster using structs.

   GCC generates better code to access hardware registers if you
   properly typedef a group of hardware registers as a struct, then access
   the registers relative to the base pointer. This way, when accessing
   a group of related registers, GCC only needs to load a literal
   for the base pointer once for the group, instead of once for each
   individual register.

=> 'register' keyword

   The 'register' keyword hints to GCC that the value will not be aliased,
   e.g. when a value is written through a pointer the 'register'ed variable
   will not be overwritten. This helps GCC generate much better code.

=> Use "volatile" qualifier and cache-through address where necessary.

   GCC will load a value once and test it, if it can:

   int wait_flag;
   while (wait_flag);

   may generate:

        mov	@r4,r0
   L5:  cmp/eq  #0,r0
        bf      L5

   unless wait_flag is declared properly.

   The volatile qualifier MUST be used on:

   a) Semaphores between mainline and interrupt code
   b) Pointers to hardware registers

   The cache-through address MUST be used on:

   a) Pointers to hardware registers

   Also, be sure variables which are accessed by cache-through are
   CONSISTENTLY accessed via cache-through - if you write to non-cached space,
   then read in cached space, you may get the cached version of the data,
   which will not be correct.

=> Be careful with cache coherency

   There are many ways to destroy cache coherency on the SH4, so one must
   be quite careful of various hardware features:

   a) SH4 DMA is NOT hardware cache coherent, so you must:

      1) Perform a writeback (flush) of the source data,

      2) Perform an invalidate of the destination data, except for the
         first and last cache lines which must be flushed.

   b) Store queue is similarly not cache coherent, so you must:

      1) Invalidate the destination data if you plan to read the data.

=> Porting from Hitachi C

   Two problems we see often when converting code from SHC to GCC:

   A) Missing volatile qualifiers.

      SHC does not optimize heavily so you can be fairly sloppy with the
      "volatile" qualifier and code will still work. Not so with GCC -
      it optimizes very heavily and it will remove redundant loads.
      See item #3 for specific circumstances where volatile must be used.

   B) Not preserving MACL and MACH in interrupt-called routines.

      SHC implements "callee preserves MACL and MACH" calling convention,
      whereas GCC does not. If you have interrupt routines written in SHC
      and you port them to GCC, they will not preserve MACL and MACH and
      your mainline code will become flaky due to MACL/MACH corruption.

=> #pragma interrupt

   "#pragma interrupt" specifies the next function defined is an interrupt
   handler. This pragma instructs GCC to:

   1) Save all modified registers. (r0-r14, macl & mach)

   2) Terminate the function with an "rte" instead of an "rts".

   If you are declaring several interrupt handlers you must insert
   "#pragma interrupt" before every interrupt function.

=> GCC code quality

   GCC produces code which is (IMHO) pretty good for SH4, but not great.
   GCC has very good target-independent optimization (common subexpression
   elimination, invariant loop expression hoisting, etc) but mediocre
   SH-specific optimizations. On complicated functions one can produce
   code which runs 50% faster than GCC output. Factors which affect
   GCC's code quality for complicated functions:

   1) Since the SH4 has only a "few" registers (compared to PPC/MIPS)
      the first scheduling pass is disabled, because it creates many
      register spills. The main effect of this is that code scheduling
      can be somewhat weak.

=> Inline assembly in C functions

   Be sure to declare your inline assembly as "__asm__ volatile" instead of
   just "__asm__" so gcc won't try to optimize and/or remove your
   inline assembly code.

   GCC has been known to optimize bits of inline assembly which aren't
   volatile, producing strange results.

   Also, if the two colons which separate the register constraints
   at the end of an inline assembly fragment are missing, GCC will
   occasionally crash. Be sure to place two colons even if there are
   no register constraints in the inline assembly.

   Incidentally, GCC will allow you to put an inline assembly section
   outside of a function, so you can write whole assembly routines
   in a C source file without wrapping them inside a C function!

   When using assembly outside of a C function, omit the "volatile"
   keyword since it isn't necessary and will only confuse the compiler.

   Note: Inline assembly in a C source file outside of a function
   is not source-level debuggable - if you wish to write large amounts
   of assembly code it's recommended you create a separate assembly file
   so it may be properly source-level debugged.

=> gprof/gcov

   gprof and gcov are included, but do not work well on the target system -
   there is no filesystem support to create files.

=> Standard C library calls - malloc(), free(), creat(), etc.

   They exist, but they require host operating system support
   through trap #34. See the source for more details.

=> .ctor and .dtor sections

   .ctor is the section for global C++ constructors, and .dtors are the
   section for global C++ destructors. They require appropriate labels
   when linking to delimit their start and end addresses, like this:

   . = ALIGN(4);
    __ctors = *;
   *(.ctors)
   __ctors_end = *;

   . = ALIGN(4);
    __dtors = *;
   *(.dtors)
   __dtors_end = *;

   (this needs to be in your linker script)

=> Structure padding

   The SH series microprocessors cannot access words on byte boundaries
   or longwords on byte boundaries. Words must be word-aligned; longwords
   must be longword-aligned.

   This means if your structures contain shorts or longs, the compiler
   will add padding on the previous element to align the short or longs
   to an acceptable address.

   The "-mpadstruct" option does NOT control this behavior. It controls
   a different structure padding behavior; it enables structure padding
   at the end of the structure to pad it out to a multiple of four bytes,
   which is backwards compatible with gcc-2.6.3's broken behavior.

=> _end

   The "_end" label is where sbrk() (called by malloc()) starts to allocate
   memory. Basically, it designates the beginning of the heap. When the
   heap pointer overlaps r15, the standard C library assumes the heap
   has overflowed into the stack.

   See "Interfacing with host OS" for more details.

=> Overlays

   See the file "overlay.txt" for more info on how to create overlays.

=> ___set_fpscr

   If you are compiling with an option which supports 64-bit
   floating-point values (-m4 or -m4-single) then the routine
   ___set_fpscr MUST be called with a single argument during
   initialization.

   This routine intializes the ___fpscr_values table which is
   used by the gcc code to switch the FPU from single to double
   precision and back.

   The value passed to ___set_fpscr is the default fpscr bits
   used in both single and double modes. Normally this is zero.
   Also, if you desire to change an FPU bit permanently, this
   can be done by calling ___set_fpscr since it modifies the
   values which gcc loads into the fpscr.

   The first entry in the fpscr_values table specifies the fpscr
   value for the opposite of the default mode (single for -m4,
   double for -m4-single) and the second value specifies the
   fpscr value for the default mode (double for -m4, single for
   -m4-single).

   NOTE: GCC assumes the SZ bit is always zero in little-endian!!
         Do not set bit 20 when calling ___set_fpscr!!

=> Spinlocks

   The atomic "test and set" instruction "tas.b" should be used to implement
   spinlocks. Here is a macro which generates tas.b:

#define tas_byte(x)                     \
({                                      \
        char *address;                  \
        int flag;                       \
        address = &x;                   \
        __asm__ volatile ("tas.b @%1; movt %0": "=r" (flag): "r" (address): "t"); \
        flag;                           \
})

=> Memory allocation functions & notes

   Documentation on the memory allocation functions used in this package
   can be obtained at http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html.

=> Interfacing with the host OS

   The standard C library included with gcc performs a "trapa #34" to call
   the host operating system for basic services. Here are the routines
   which are called:

   read:   trapa #34, r4: SYS_read,   r5: file,   r6: ptr,   r7: len
   lseek:  trapa #34, r4: SYS_lseek,  r5: file,   r6: ptr,   r7: dir
   write:  trapa #34, r4: SYS_write,  r5: file,   r6: ptr,   r7: len
   close:  trapa #34, r4: SYS_close,  r5: file,   r6: 0,     r7: 0

   sbrk:   this is internal to libc now, just set  "_end" to the end
           of your program + data area, and it will allocate from "_end"
           until it hits the stack pointer.

   open:   trapa #34, r4: SYS_open,   r5: path,   r6: flags, r7: 0
   creat:  trapa #34, r4: SYS_creat,  r5: path,   r6: mode,  r7: 0
   exit:   trapa #34, r4: SYS_exit,   r5: n,      r6: 0,     r7: 0
   kill:   trapa #34, r4: SYS_exit,   r5: 0xdead, r6: 0,     r7: 0
   stat:   trapa #34, r4: SYS_stat,   r5: path,   r6: st
   chmod:  trapa #34, r4: SYS_chmod,  r5: path,   r6: mode
   chown:  trapa #34, r4: SYS_chown,  r5: path,   r6: owner, r7: group
   utime:  trapa #34, r4: SYS_utime,  r5: path,   r6: times
   fork:   trapa #34, r4: SYS_fork
   wait:   trapa #34, r4: SYS_wait
   execve: trapa #34, r4: SYS_execve, r5: path,   r6: argv,  r7: envp
   execv:  trapa #34, r4: SYS_execv   r5: path,   r6: argv
   pipe:   trapa #34, r4: SYS_pipe,   r5: fd

Helpful tips and tricks - debugging
-----------------------------------

=> Easier source-code debugging

   If you disable the GCC/G++ second scheduling pass with "-fno-schedule-insns2"
   your code will be easier to debug because your source code pointer
   will jump around less in the debugger.

   This changes the compiler's code generation, and the code will be slower,
   so it could affect the bug you're trying to isolate, so please be careful
   with its usage.

   I also recommend NOT using -fomit-frame-pointer when debugging.
   The debugger relies upon the frame pointer to access local variables,
   so if the frame pointer is omitted, the debugger will not be able
   to properly display local variables for that function!

=> Post-morteming crashes

   When the SH4 crashes, the best thing to do is to examine the PR register
   to determine the return address of the offending routine. This will often
   tell you which routine has crashed. This applies to C and C++ code as well
   as assembly code.

=> C++ name demangler

   There is a C++ name demangler called "c++filt" in this package.
   If you type in a mangled name, the utility will return a demangled
   function name and arguments.

----------------------------------------------
Helpful tips and tricks - assembly programming
----------------------------------------------

=> The .align directive

   .align in GAS specifies the number of least-significant zero bits,
   NOT the actual alignment value. For example. .align 1 is 2 byte aligned,
   .align 2 is 4 byte aligned, .align 5 is 32-byte aligned.

=> Using literals in assembly

   Don't forget to align your literals! (.align 2) Failure to do so will
   cause you to spend hours tracking down bus error bugs! Also, if you
   have word literals put them at the end of your literal section so
   they won't misalign any following longword literals.

   When using literals in assembly, be sure to place your byte literals first,
   then an .align 1 (for 2 byte alignment), then all the word literals,
   then a .align 2 (for 4 byte alignment) then all your longword literals.
   We recommend this because byte and word literals have smaller pc-relative
   offsets than longword literals.

   GAS also will not report illegal instructions (jump/branch) or stupid
   (i.e. pc-relative) instructions in delay slots.

=> GCC parameter passing conventions:

   Integer registers:

        r0: Function integer return value (if any)
            (r1 also used if return is type "long long")

     r0-r3: Temporaries. Assumed destroyed by called function.

     r4-r7: First four integer arguments.
		   Assumed destroyed by called function.

    r8-r15: Assumed preserved by called functions.

      Note: Be sure to sign or zero-extend your chars and shorts in r4-r7
            before calling a C function! GCC expects arguments in registers
            to be fully sign extended to an int.

   Floating-point register:

   	   fr0: Function floating-point return value (if any)

   fr0-fr3: Temporaries. Asssumed destroyed by called function.

  fr4-fr11: First eight floating-point arguments.
            Assumed destroyed by called function.

  fr12-fr14: Assumed preserved by called function.

   Other registers:

         pr: Processor return - must be preserved, obviously.

        gbr: gcc currently does not generate code which utilizes the gbr -
	         so your assembly routines are free to use the gbr.

  macl, mach, fpul: Assumed to be destroyed.

   fpscr: depends on -m4, -m4-single, or -m4-single-only.

=> Source-level debugging GAS assembly

   The easiest way to assemble assembly files into .o files with debugging
   information is to use the ".S" extension (MUST be uppercase) and assemble
   them with gcc:

   gcc -g -c file.S

   gcc will call cpp and as with the appropriate commands to properly assemble
   the files with source-level debug information.

   Incidentally, this also enables you to use all C preprocessor commands,
   e.g. "#define", "#if ... #else ... #endif", in your assembly source files.

=> Stupid (but useful) assembly tricks:

   A) Use MACL, MACH, and GBR as temporaries.
   B) Save pr in a register (sts.l pr,r14)

----------------------
Writing efficient code
----------------------

=> Use local variables.

   Global variables are slow - to retrieve the value, the SH4 typically
   must execute:

   mov.l L2,r1
   mov.l @r1,r1

   Local variables are faster - it's stack-relative, and parameters
   are even faster because the first four integers parameters are passed
   in r4-r7 and first eight floating-point parameters in fr4-fr11.

=> Write small functions.

   We've noticed GCC generates very pessimal code when it starts to
   spill registers, so try to avoid doing too much in one function.

   A function which exceeds more than about a hundred lines should
   be broken into smaller functions.

=> Read structure fields sequentially forwards; but write them sequentially
   in reverse (if possible).

   This works well because gcc can use post-increment reads when reading,
   and pre-decrement writes when writing.

=> Use the "register" keyword (mostly for locals)

   The usage of the "register" keyword allows gcc to determine that
   memory writes cannot possibly overwrite this variable, so it's more
   likely to be registerized.

=> Avoid weird casts

   The ANSI C standard allows the compiler to assume that pointers to 
   different types do not alias; e.g. int * and float * never point
   to the same location. If you cast floats to ints or to other types
   then you may confuse the compiler and incorrect code may be generated.

=> When defining automatics in functions, define non-array items first,
   in order of number of times accessed, then array items.

   For this sample:

void func(void)

{
        int foo[256];
        volatile int bar;

        bar = 0;
}

GCC will generate this code, which requires two instructions to access "bar":

_func:
        mov.w   L3,r3
        mov.l   r14,@-r15
        mov.w   L4,r0		<- r0 = 1024
        mov.w   L3,r7
        sub     r3,r15
        mov     #0,r2
        mov     r15,r14
        mov.l   r2,@(r0,r14)	<- bar at r15 + 1024
        add     r7,r14
        mov     r14,r15
        rts
        mov.l   @r15+,r14
        .align 1
L3:
        .short  1028
L4:
        .short  1024

If you rearrage the function so that "bar" is defined first:

void func(void)

{
        volatile int bar;
        int foo[256];

        bar = 0;
}

~
then GCC will generate this code, which only requires a single instruction
to access "bar":

_func:
        mov.w   L3,r3
        mov.l   r14,@-r15
        mov.w   L3,r7
        sub     r3,r15
        mov     #0,r1
        mov     r15,r14
        mov.l   r1,@r14		<- bar at @r14
        add     r7,r14
        mov     r14,r15
        rts
        mov.l   @r15+,r14
        .align 1
L3:
        .short  1028
