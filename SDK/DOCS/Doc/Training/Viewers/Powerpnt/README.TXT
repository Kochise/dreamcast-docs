Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 97 for Windows 95 and Windows NT


Microsoft(r) PowerPoint Viewer 97, is a freeware product that allows you to view and print Microsoft PowerPoint(r) 97 documents. Like previous versions of PowerPoint Viewer, the latest version can also open presentations created with all previous versions of PowerPoint for Windows(r), and version 3.0 and above of Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh(r). You cannot edit a presentation in PowerPoint Viewer 97. Microsoft encourages you to distribute PowerPoint Viewer 97 with your PowerPoint 97 presentations to people who are not using Microsoft PowerPoint 97. (See the section "Distribution of PowerPoint Viewer" for further information.)
Microsoft(r) PowerPoint Viewer 97 will not run on Windows 3.1. Windows 3.1 users should instead install PowerPoint Viewer for Windows 3.1. PowerPoint Viewer for Windows 3.1 is available online as a self-extracting executable file (PptVw16.exe) at any of the following locations:
* Microsoft's World Wide Web site on the Internet: On the www.microsoft.com home page, click the Support icon. Then click Knowledge Base, and select the product and search for articles that contain the text "PptVw16.exe". The articles will contain hyperlinks so you can download the file.
* Internet (anonymous FTP): Use a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) utility to connect to ftp.microsoft.com with anonymous logon. Then change to the Softlib\Mslfiles folder. Use the GET command (get PptVw16.exe) to download the file.
* Microsoft Download Service (MSDL): You can connect to this bulletin board by dialing (425) 936-6735. Then follow the instructions to download a file and download "PptVw16.exe".
A disk set containing both viewers can also be ordered from the Microsoft Order Desk, at (800) 360-7561, for a standard shipping and handling charge.

What's New in Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 97

Go previous:		PAGE UP key
Exit:			ESC key
Menu of commands:	Right mouse button
Help:			F1 key


Command-line switches
PowerPoint Viewer supports some command-line parameters to circumvent the user interface (UI). Command lines should be of the following format:

ppview32.exe [command-line switches] "<path\powerpnt file name>"
The following command-line parameters are supported:
	Automatic advance	/A or /a
	Slide range		/R=n-m or /r=n-m where n<=m
	Loop continuously	/L or /l

[command-line switches] "<path\powerpnt file name>"
[command-line switches] "<path\powerpnt file name>"
etc...

The following command-line switches are supported:
	Automatic advance	/A or /a
	Slide range		/R=n-m or /r=n-m where n<=m
	Loop continuously	/L or /l
	Kiosk password		/K or /k for setting a kiosk mode for file
	Macro virus dialog box	/V or /v for showing the macro virus dialog box


Interaction with Pack and Go
PowerPoint 95 defaults to packaging the 16-bit viewer (PptView.exe). PowerPoint 97 defaults to packaging PowerPoint Viewer 95. It is possible to use Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 97 for Windows. This is accomplished by installing the new viewer. After installing PowerPoint Viewer 97, the Pack and Go wizard will automatically detect and use the new viewer. 

Long filenames are truncated to 8.3 format on Windows NT.


Viewing presentations with RealAudio sounds
Some PowerPoint presentations may contain links to RealAudio sounds. Using RealAudio provides better audio performance when viewing presentations over a network connection. However, the RealAudio player is not installed by PowerPoint Viewer 97 Setup. You can install the RealAudio player from  the following Internet address:
http://www.realaudio.com


Viewing presentations within Netscape Navigator
In order to view PowerPoint presentations within the Netscape Navigator browser window you must install the ActiveX plug-in for Netscape Navigator (versions 2.x or higher). You can download and install this plug-in from the following Internet address:  http://www.microsoft.com/powerpoint/internet/viewer/   
Note: There are known problems when this plug-in is used with Internet Explorer and earlier versions of Office applications. Do not install this plug-in if you are using, or plan to use, Internet Explorer and Office 4.x or Office 95 applications.  


Controlling PowerPoint Viewer 97 from Other Applications
PowerPoint Viewer 97 contains an object model that allows control of the slideshow from an external application or from VBScript. Below is a summary of the PowerPoint Viewer object model.

ViewerApplication 
#define _ppMsoTriStateMixed -2
#define _ppTrue -1
#define _ppFalse 0

typedef enum
{
   ppSlideShowManualAdvance = 1,
   ppSlideShowUseSlideTimings,
} EPPSlideShowAdvanceMode;

 IPPViewerSlideShowView *NewShow( [in] BSTR fileName,
      				         [in] EPPViewerSlideShowAdvanceMode mode, 
         [in,defaultvalue(_ppFalse)] MsoTriState kiosk );

void Quit( void );

ViewerSlideShowView 
   void Next();
   void Previous();
   void GotoSlide([in] int Index, [in,defaultvalue(_ppTrue)] MsoTriState ResetSlide );

   void GetNumSlides([out] int* count );
   void GetCurSlide( [out] int* slideId );
 
   void Exit();


Known Problems
1. Netscape Navigator Web browser: If PowerPoint Viewer is installed to a directory that uses long filenames containing a space, some beta versions of Netscape Navigator 2.0 do not recognize PowerPoint files embedded into HTML documents with the EMBED keyword. This can be corrected by installing PowerPoint Viewer to a directory without spaces.

2. Pack and Go: If either PowerPoint 97 or PowerPoint Viewer are installed to a directory that uses long filenames containing a space, Slide Show will not run automatically when the file is unpacked. The file will have to be opened manually from either PowerPoint or PowerPoint Viewer after it is unpacked.

3. Pack and Go: Hyperlinks to other presentations may not work properly if Slide Show is run automatically during the unpack process.  Instead, open the file manually from PowerPoint Viewer after unpacking is complete.

4. Pack and Go: In order to pack PowerPoint Viewer 97 using PowerPoint 95 Pack and Go, please install PowerPoint Viewer 97 and the patch for PowerPoint 95 Pack and Go. Both will be available on the PowerPoint Web site:
http://www.microsoft.com/powerpoint/internet/viewer/

5. Kiosk Password: If the user follows a hyperlink to another presentation, then presses the ESC key, the Password dialog box will be displayed.  After dismissing the dialog box, the user will be returned to the main presentation.  Pressing the ESC key a second time will exit PowerPoint Viewer without showing the Password dialog box again.

Installation and Maintenance
Install from floppy disk
1. Close all other applications and ensure that you are not running any utilities or virus protection programs.
2. Insert the disk labeled "Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 97 for Windows Disk 1" into the 3.5" floppy disk drive.
3. On Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0, click the Start button and click Run.  On Windows NT 3.51, click the File menu and select Run.
4. Type <drive letter>\setup.exe and press ENTER.

6. After choosing the folder location for PowerPoint Viewer, click Install.
7. Follow the instructions and insert the appropriate floppy disk, when prompted.
Install from Web browser 
1. Download Viewer.exe to your local hard drive.
2. Close all other applications and ensure that you are not running any utilities or virus protection programs.
3. In Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 or the Windows NT 3.51 File Manager, double-click the PowerPoint Viewer icon. This will run an unpack utility that extracts the PowerPoint Viewer 97 distribution files and starts the PowerPoint Viewer 97 Setup program.
4. PowerPoint Viewer 97 Setup will prompt you for a folder in which to install PowerPoint Viewer. The default folder location for PowerPoint Viewer is \Program Files\PowerPoint Viewer  (C:\PowerPoint Viewer on Windows NT 3.51). 
5. After choosing the folder location for PowerPoint Viewer, click Install.

Maintenance mode

Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0
1. In the Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.
2. Click the Install/Uninstall tab. 
3. Double-click Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 97.
Windows NT 3.51
1. Go to PowerPoint Viewer's Installation Directory.
2. Run the file Setup.exe.

In all cases, Setup will display a Maintenance Mode dialog box that has a Reinstall button to restore any missing files or settings. Click this button to start the reinstallation.
Uninstall
To remove PowerPoint Viewer 97 from your system, follow the instructions in this document to start Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 97 Setup. When the Maintenance Mode dialog box appears, click Remove All. Once uninstall is complete, start PowerPoint to restore its settings.
 
Distribution of PowerPoint Viewer
Microsoft encourages all users of PowerPoint Viewer to distribute it to friends and colleagues. You can post it to online services, put it on networks, or give it to others on disks.
Disk distribution
Microsoft distributes PowerPoint Viewer 97 on two disks as well as online. The disk set is available from the Microsoft Order Desk, at (800) 360-7561, for a standard shipping and handling charge.
If you have a Microsoft disk set you can copy the files from each disk onto a formatted 1.44MB disk. Please label the disks as follows:

Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 97
Version 8.0
Disk 1 of 2
Run Setup.exe from this disk
and:
Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 97
Version 8.0
Disk 2 of 2

Labeling the disks in this manner will avoid confusing them with disk sets created from online PowerPoint Viewer 97 files as described in this document.
Creating disks from online files
There are two procedures for creating disks for distribution to other users. The first procedure involves copying files that Setup creates, and must be done just before exiting Setup. The second procedure requires PKZip (version 2.04), but can be done at any time after downloading Viewer.exe. Obtain two formatted 1.44 MB disks and follow the instructions below: 
Setup copy procedure
1. Label two disks "Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 97 disk 1" and "Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 97 disk 2".
2. Run Viewer.exe to start PowerPoint Viewer 97 Setup. When Setup displays the message "Do you want to install Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 97?", switch to the Windows 95 Explorer or Windows NT File Manager.
3. Locate the folder referenced by the "tmp" environment variable. If you do not know which folder this is, do the following:
* Go to the MS-DOS prompt.
* Type "set" (without the quotes) at the MS-DOS prompt, and press Enter.
* Look for the line "TMP=..." to determine the location of your "tmp" folder.
4. Insert the disk you labeled as "disk1" and copy the following files from the "tmp" folder to the disk:
* install.txt
* license.txt
* setup.exe
* setup.ini
* setup.lst
* setup.tdf
* ppviewer.inf
* viewer1.cab
5. Insert the disk you labeled as "disk2" and copy viewer2.cab to it.
PKZip procedure
You must have the PKZip version 2.04 program for this procedure. This program is widely available on bulletin boards and other online services.
1.  Insert the first disk into your floppy drive.
2.  From the Windows 95 Start Menu or the Windows NT Program Manager, start an MS-DOS command prompt.
3.  At the MS-DOS command prompt type
pkzip -& <floppy>:\Viewer.zip Viewer.exe
where "<floppy>" is the letter for the drive containing the disk. This command creates an archive that spans two disks. PKZip will prompt you for the next disk when it has filled the current one.
To install PowerPoint Viewer 97 on another machine using the ZIP file:
1. Create a new folder from which to do the install.
2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type
pkunzip <floppy>:\Viewer.zip <drive>:\<destfolder>\Viewer.exe
where "<floppy>" is the letter for the drive containing the disk, and "<drive>" and "<destfolder>" are the drive letter and new install folder you want to place Viewer.exe in.
3. Double-click Viewer.exe to start Setup.

Distributing PowerPoint Viewer 97 on network servers
Creating a network source from a Microsoft disk set
(See "Disk Distribution" in this document for information on obtaining PowerPoint Viewer 97 on disks.)
To create a network source for PowerPoint Viewer 97 installation, create a new folder on the server, and create two subfolders under it: "disk1", and "disk2". Copy the files from each disk into the appropriate subfolder.
To install PowerPoint Viewer on your local drive, or to a personal network location, run Setup.exe from the "disk1" subfolder.
Note: PowerPoint Viewer 97 Setup does not offer an option to run the application from a server ("Run from Server" option).
Creating a network source from the PowerPoint Viewer 97 online files (Viewer.exe)
The recommended procedure is nearly identical to the "Setup Copy Procedure" discussed in this document for creating disks from online files. Instead of copying the files to separate folders for each disk, copy them to a single folder on the network server. Network users may then run Setup.exe from that location on their local drives, or to a personal network location.
