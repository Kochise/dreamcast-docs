MARSHAL - Standard Marshaling of Custom Interfaces


SUMMARY
=======

The MARSHAL sample anticipates the interaction of a client and
out-of-process server in the LOCCLIEN and LOCSERVE samples. For a client
like LOCCLIEN to use the COM objects in an out-of-process server like
LOCSERVE requires marshaling the car-related interfaces used in the
previous COM samples of this series. The MARSHAL sample creates a
proxy/stub DLL that provides standard marshaling for the ICar, IUtility,
and ICruise custom interfaces.

The Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL) compiler is used
to compile the interface specifications (expressed using the MIDL language
in the MICARS.IDL file). MIDL.EXE is a utility provided as part of the
Microsoft Platform SDK. The MIDL compilation of MICARS.IDL generates
additional source files: MICARS.H, MICARS_I.C, MICARS_P.C, and DLLDATA.C.

In the series of COM Tutorial code samples, MARSHAL works with the
LOCSERVE and LOCCLIEN samples to illustrate a COM client using the
interfaces on COM objects in an out-of-process local server. In this
sample series, only standard marshaling is used for the custom ICar,
IUtility, and ICruise interfaces. Later samples in the series which use
these interfaces across apartment, process, or machine boundaries (for
example, APTSERVE, APTCLIEN, and REMCLIEN) also rely on MARSHAL.DLL for
standard marshaling of these interfaces.

The MARSHAL sample demonstrates a simple and efficient way to create a
marshaling DLL for custom interfaces. Default definitions are generated
for the DllMain, DllGetClassObject, DllCanUnloadNow, GetProxyDllInfo,
DllRegisterServer, and DllUnregisterServer functions. With this technique,
all that is needed is a makefile, a .DEF file, and an input .IDL file
specifying the interfaces. However, there may be occasions when you want
more control over the content of the marshaling DLL. For example, you may
want to perform some action within DllMain during DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, you
may want to code explicit control over the registration and unregistration
of the marshaling server, or you may want to add standard module version
information to the DLL resources. For coverage of these areas, see the
subsequent MARSHAL2 sample. MARSHAL2 produces a marshaling DLL that
marshals the same custom interfaces as MARSHAL. When registered,
MARSHAL2.DLL is functionally equivalent to MARSHAL.DLL and replaces it.
The makefile for the MARSHAL2.DLL does not automatically register the
server to achieve this replacement. You must enable this in MARSHAL2's
makefile. For the MARSHAL2 lesson, see MARSHAL2.HTM.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of MARSHAL, see the
Code Tour section in MARSHAL.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of MARSHAL.DLL, see the Usage section in MARSHAL.HTM.
To read MARSHAL.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the MARSHAL lesson in the table of lessons. You can also do the same
thing by double-clicking the MARSHAL.HTM file after locating the main
tutorial directory in Windows Explorer. For more details on the LOCCLIEN
client and the LOCSERVE server and how MARSHAL.DLL supports their
operation, see LOCSERVE.HTM and LOCCLIEN.HTM in the main tutorial
directory. Because those code samples rely on MARSHAL.DLL, you must build
MARSHAL DLL before building or running LOCCLIEN and LOCSERVE. MARSHAL's
makefile automatically registers MARSHAL's proxy and stub interface
marshalers in the system registry. This registration must be done before
these interfaces can be used by COM clients or servers in LOCSERVE,
LOCCLIEN, and later samples of the series.

MARSHAL's self-registration is done using the REGISTER.EXE utility built
in the REGISTER sample. To build or run MARSHAL, you must build the
REGISTER code sample first.

For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE
is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.


Usage
-----

MARSHAL.DLL is built solely as a marshaling DLL for the specified
interfaces. Although it can be implicitly loaded by linking to its
associated .LIB file, it is normally used on behalf of a COM client that
is using the interfaces across apartment, process, or machine boundaries.
In these cases COM automatically loads this DLL as needed. Before COM can
find and load the MARSHAL DLL to support marshaling of its supported
interfaces, the MARSHAL server must be registered in the registry as the
marshaling server for those interfaces. MARSHAL is a self-registering
in-process server.

The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the MARSHAL directory:

  nmake register

This assumes that you have a compilation environment set up. If not, you
can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the MARSHAL directory.

  ..\register\register.exe marshal.dll

These registration commands require a prior build of the REGISTER sample
in this series, as well as a prior build of MARSHAL.DLL.

In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Microsoft Platform SDK and
Visual C++ include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which can be used in a
similar fashion to register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.
