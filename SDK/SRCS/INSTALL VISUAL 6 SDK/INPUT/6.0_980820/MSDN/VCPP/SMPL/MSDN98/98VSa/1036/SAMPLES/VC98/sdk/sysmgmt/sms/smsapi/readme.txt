This directory contains sample programs for the
SMS C api.  

The makefiles for each sample program includes
"..\paths.mk", thus you need to make sure that
this file is present in the parent directory
when you build each sample program. Before 
building the samples, edit "paths.mk" 
and change the paths specified there to match
your system's configuration.  Also note that the
DEST directory, specified in "paths.mk", must
exist before you can build the sample applications.
