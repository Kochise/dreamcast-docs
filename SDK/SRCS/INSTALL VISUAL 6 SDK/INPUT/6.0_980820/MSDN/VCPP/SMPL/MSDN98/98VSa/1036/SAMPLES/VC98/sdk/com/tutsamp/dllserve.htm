<h2><a name="DLLSERVE">DLLSERVE - Component Object DLL Server</a></h2>

<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
The COMOBJ sample introduced COM objects. This DLLSERVE sample introduces
COM components (also called simply component objects). A component object
is a reusable software unit that encapsulates or packages the
manufacturing of a specific class of COM object. A COM object class
specifies an open-ended set of behaviorally identical COM objects that is
uniquely identified for all programs and all time (by a Class ID).

<P>
Component objects are housed in a COM Server. The server executable is
registered (or published) in a system registry to act as the creation
agent for COM object instances of the COM Component. The server contains
one or more Class Factories used for the creation of COM objects. Class
factories are themselves COM objects that expose the IClassfactory[2]
interface.  However, as an integral part of the server housing, class
factories are typically not full-fledged component objects.

<P>
Component objects are the building blocks in COM and ActiveX programming.
Component objects are combined to make some portion of an application. The
running behavior of the applicaion is often determined by, and evidenced
in, the COM objects that were instantiated (i.e., that were manufactured
in the class factories of the various component objects that were combined
in the application).

<P>
The DLLSERVE sample begins with the car-related COM Objects of the
previous COMOBJ lesson and refashions them into component objects. To do
so requires little change to the COM objects themselves (COCar,
COUtilityCar, and COCruiseCar). But to envelop them as components, this
lesson introduces new facilities to house them in an in-process DLL COM
server. These facilities include class factories for each component and a
CarSample utility component that allows clients to see logged behavior in
the server itself.

<P>
The DLL server provides the following components: Car, UtilityCar, CruiseCar,
and CarSample.

<P>
In the series of COM tutorial code samples, DLLSERVE works with the
DLLCLIEN code sample to illustrate DLLSERVE's COM server facilities for
creating components that can be used by an EXE client and the subsequent
manipulation of those components by DLLCLIEN.EXE.

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of DLLSERVE, see the
Code Tour section in DLLSERVE.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of DLLSERVE, see the Usage section in DLLSERVE.HTM. To
read DLLSERVE.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the DLLSERVE lesson in the table of lessons. You can also achieve
the same thing by clicking the DLLSERVE.HTM file after locating the main
tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also DLLCLIEN.HTM in the
main tutorial directory for more details on the DLLCLIEN client
application and how it works with DLLSERVE.DLL.

<P>
You must build DLLSERVE.DLL before building or running DLLCLIEN.
DLLSERVE's makefile automatically registers DLLSERVE's components in the
registry. These components must be registered before DLLSERVE is available
to outside COM clients as a server for those components. This registration
is done using the REGISTER.EXE utility built in the previous REGISTER
lesson. To build or run DLLSERVE, you should build the REGISTER code
sample first.

<P>
For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

<P>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<P>
DLLSERVE is a DLL that is meant to be used primarily as a COM server.
Though it can be implicitly loaded by linking to its associated .LIB file,
it is normally used after an explicit LoadLibrary call (usually from COM's
CoGetClassObject function). Servers like DLLSERVE are registered in the
registry. To use DLLSERVE in a COM client program, a client does not need
to include DLLSERVE.H or link to DLLSERVE.LIB. A COM client of DLLSERVE
obtains access solely through its components' CLSIDs and COM services. For
DLLSERVE, those CLSIDs are CLSID_DllCar, CLSID_DllUtilityCar,
CLSID_DllCruiseCar, and CLSID_DllCarSample. The DLLCLIEN lesson shows how
this is done.

<P>
The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the DLLSERVE directory:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  nmake register
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This assumes that you have a compilation environment set up. If not, you
can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the DLLSERVE directory.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  ..\register\register.exe dllserve.dll
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
These registration commands require a prior build of the REGISTER sample
in this series, as well as a prior build of DLLSERVE.DLL.

<P>
In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Platform SDK and Visual C++&reg;
include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which can be used in a similar fashion to
register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.

<h4>Run the Sample</h4>

<p>
The client sample and other related samples must be compiled before
you can run the client. For more details on building the samples, see
<a href="using.htm#building">
Building the Code Samples.</a>

<P>
If you have already built the appropriate samples, DLLCLIEN.EXE is the
client executable to run for this sample.

<a href="DLLCLIEN\DLLCLIEN.exe">
Click here to run DLLCLIEN.EXE.</a>

<P>
Depending on the security level of your browser you may see a dialog
allowing you to either open the .EXE file or save it to disk. Click the
"Open it" choice and then click the OK button.

 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This code sample is based on the code in the COMOBJ lesson. The same COM
objects studied in COMOBJ and COMUSER are encountered here again in
DLLSERVE: COCar, COUtilityCar, and COCruiseCar. Some minor changes have
been made to house these objects in a COM server. More on this below.

<P>
DLLSERVE is a server that manages several component types. This need not
be the case. A COM server might need to manage only one component type.
If you're modeling such a single component server on DLLSERVE, it is easy
to remove the code for the other components.

<P>
DLLSERVE uses many of the utility classes and services provided by
APPUTIL. For more details on APPUTIL, study the APPUTIL library's source
code in the sibling \APPUTIL directory and APPUTIL.HTM in the main
tutorial directory.

<P>
The main elements of the DLLSERVE and DLLCLIEN code samples are the
mechanisms required to render COM objects into components by housing them
in a DLL (in-process) server. Subsequent lessons will perform this same
kind of evolution of COM objects by housing them as licensed in-process
components (LICSERVE and LICCLIEN) and by housing them as components in an
EXE (out-of-process) server (LOCSERVE and LOCCLIEN).

<P>
All of these COM servers are self-registering. The previous lesson in
this series presented a small REGISTER.EXE utility that DLLSERVE will use
for self-registration. We'll look first at the support for this facility
that is provided in DLLSERVE. We will then see how the class factories
are built. We'll tour the mechanism for control of the server as objects
are created and deleted. We'll look at a new component (CarSample) that
integrates the logging faciities of the server and the client to provide
more instructive code samples. Finally, we'll look at the changes made to
the COM object classes of the components themselves. This last section
won't be long, because these COM object classes are almost the same as
those presented in COMOBJ and COMUSER.

<P>
We start in DLLSERVE.H. Two exported functions, DllRegisterServer and
DllUnregisterServer, are implemented to manage registration of the
components. Both functions are declared for import in the manner seen in
the DLLSKEL and COMOBJ lessons. The STDENTRY macro from DLLSERVE.H is used
when applications want to build a .LIB file from DLLSERVE.DLL and then
link to DLLSERVE.LIB in order to import these two functions. However, the
macro is not used to define them as exports, as was done in earlier code
samples. In this code sample, the desired functions are specified as
exported in the a DLLSERVE.DEF module definition file. This .DEF file is
submitted to the Linker in the makefile's Link command line as follows.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">

<P>
The Linker's -def:$*.def command line switch is used above. This reduces
to -def:DLLSERVE.DEF when the makefile is processed. Here is the content
of DLLSERVE.DEF.

</FONT> </PRE>

Export definition is done differently in this code sample because using
the STDENTRY macro for the export definitions (as was done in the COMOBJ
sample) may yield compile-time errors (linkage conflict). These errors
happen because functions like DllGetClassObject are already declared in
the COM/OLE header files, and these prototypes do not currently include
linkage instructions in their signature. Thus, for COM servers, the
DllClassObject, DllCanUnloadNow, DllRegisterServer, and
DllUnregisterServer functions are considered exports that are intended for
internal, private use only by COM. The linker is told explicitly--in the
export statements of the DLLSERVE.DEF file--to mark those functions as
PRIVATE exports. This also excludes those functions from any import
libraries that may be produced during Linking.

<P>
The above export approach applies especially to the DllGetClassObject and
DllCanUnloadNow functions, which all COM component servers must implement.
More on them later.

<P>
First, look at DllRegisterServer (in DLLSERVE.CPP). The following fragment
shows what it does.

      szCLSID,
      NULL,
      TEXT(&quot;DllCar Component - DLLSERVE Code Sample&quot;));
    SetRegKeyValue(
      szCLSID,

      TEXT(&quot;DllCar1.0&quot;));
    SetRegKeyValue(
      szCLSID,
      TEXT(&quot;VersionIndependentProgID&quot;),
      TEXT(&quot;DllCar&quot;));
    SetRegKeyValue(
      szCLSID,
      TEXT(&quot;NotInsertable&quot;),
      NULL);
    SetRegKeyValue(
      szCLSID,
      TEXT(&quot;InprocServer32&quot;),
      szModulePath);

    ...
    ...
    [Similar for UtilityCar, CruiseCar, and CarSample.]
    ...
    ...

    return hr;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
Notice the specific CLSIDs, such as CLSID_DllCar, used for these component
types. A CLSID is important in distinguishing a component from the
in-process COM objects that were introduced in the previous code samples.
As we shall see, other work must be done to fully flesh them out as
components.

<P>
These CLSIDs must be unique, hence the DllCar, DllUtilityCar, and
DllCruiseCar in their names. Even though these components are similar to
the COCar, COUtilityCar, and COCruiseCar COM objects, different CLSIDs
must be created for them when they reside in other servers. All the
car-related CLSIDs, GUIDs, and interfaces are declared in CARGUIDS.H and
ICARS.H, in sibling directory \INC. These include files are common to all
the code samples in this tutorial series.

<P>
The CLSIDs are like tickets to the servers. You present a CLSID to COM to
get components from the servers that house them. Though different servers
may create COCar COM objects, the client's access to these objects is
first through their component type CLSID, which gets to their server,
which in turn can create them. Subsequent use of the COM objects by the
client is solely through COM interfaces on the objects themselves.

<P>
The internal avenue from the CLSID of a component type to its server is
provided by appropriate entries in the system registry. One way to get
those entries into the registry is to have the server that manages a
component type put them there. That is what the DllRegisterServer
function does for each component type.

<P>
The StringFromGUID2 service is called to convert the GUID corresponding to
CLSID_DllCar into a string that can be stored in the registry. Most of the
work is in constructing the proper strings to write into the registry. The
CLSIDs themselves are stored as registry keys under the CLSID subkey,
which is in turn under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. All of these entries are stored
in the registry under the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key. You can look at these
entries by running the Registry Editor utility that is provided as part of
the operating system (REGEDIT.EXE under Windows 95, and REGEDT32.EXE under
Windows NT).

<P>
Note that this sample assumes that all registration is under the main
registry key of HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. The same content that is in the
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT branch can also be accessed in the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes branch. These two branches of the
Registry can be used interchangeably.

<P>
Aside from the CLSID itself (which ties a component type's CLSID to its
COM server), other registry entries are written for
VersionIndependentProgID and ProgID. For the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID
entry, because this server is in a DLL, the path to the server is the
value of an 'InprocServer32' subkey. This value will probably be
different on each system, so the function GetModuleFileName is
called to dynamically determine where the executing server is located.
This approach is more convenient than using .REG files, but it does
require running a small utility such as REGISTER.EXE or SELFREG.EXE. It
also requires that a runnable copy of the server be present, which may not
always be the case.

<P>
To make the code example easier to read and maintain, these keys, subkeys,
and values are written to the registry within DllRegisterServer using
calls to the SetRegKeyValue local function.

<P>
The entries for each server's component types are removed from the
registry within DllUnregisterServer using calls to the RegDeleteKey COM
function. These are the same entries that DllRegisterServer had previously
written to the registry. Here is DllUnregisterServer (in DLLSERVE.CPP).

<P>
We turn next to class factories. To be a COM server is to expose the class
factories for the component types the server supports. These class
factories create instances of the component types supported. In the
process, much like the CreatexxxCar functions of the COMOBJ sample, they
pass the client a requested interface pointer to the new COM object. Part
of the elegance of COM is in how it is built using itself. Class factories
can illustrate this point. The class factories in this code sample are
themselves COM objects that implement the standard COM IClassFactory
interface. IClassFactory is called a standard interface because it is
provided by COM and is pre-declared in the system header files.

<P>
Outside the COM server, COM is made aware of the class factories through a
DllGetClassObject function that the server must implement and export.
We'll see in the DLLCLIEN lesson how the client presents a CLSID to COM to
get a class factory, then uses it to create the object, and then uses the
object through its interfaces.

<P>
Here's the whole of DllGetClassObject (again from DLLSERVE.CPP).

<P>
For a given CLSID, the function creates the appropriate new CFCarXXX class
factory COM object. A pointer to the requested interface on the new class
factory COM object (usually IClassFactory) is then obtained by a call to
QueryInterface. To create an object, the CreateInstance method of the
obtained IClassFactory interface is then called by the client. This
DllGetClassObject is not called directly by the client, but by COM on
behalf of clients, usually through such COM services as CoGetClassObject
or CoCreateInstance. More on this in the DLLCLIEN lesson.

<P>
The CFCarXXX class factory object obtained is also a component in its own
right. When a class factory object is created or destroyed, it maintains
its server's object count by calling the ObjectsUp and ObjectsDown
functions of the appropriate server control object. There will be more on
these calls later when we look at the server control object itself and at
the actual car-related application components to see how they are related
to the server as components.

<P>
All the CFxxx class factories are declared in FACTORY.H and implemented in
FACTORY.CPP. Throughout most of the rest of this tour of the class
factories, we'll use the Car component's server code as a representative
example. Unless stated otherwise, this server code applies by direct
analogy to the other class factories. From FACTORY.H, here is the
declaration for CFCar.

<P>
This code should look familiar, since there were a lot of COM objects very
much like this in the COMOBJ and COMUSER code samples. Here again we see
the pattern of nested classes used to implement the multiple interfaces on
this COM object, in this case IUnknown and IClassFactory. We see
prototypes for the two IClassFactory methods, CreateInstance and
LockServer. We won't repeat the discussion of COM object construction that
was covered in COMOBJ. Return to that lesson if you don't recognize the
COM object pattern of this code.

<P>
We will focus here on the code that constructs this class factory so that,
when CreateInstance is called, the class factory creates its COM objects
and gives those objects access to their server. To consolidate and
encapsulate this internal access to the server housing, a CServer server
control object is used. The server control object is a C++ object, not a
COM object. In this scheme, only one server control object is implemented
for the entire server, regardless of how many component types the server
manages.

<P>
For now we'll examine how a pointer to the server control object is passed
into the labyrinth of COM objects, their interface implementations, and
the components that are actually manufactured. First notice the CFCar
constructor.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  CFCar(IUnknown* pUnkOuter, CServer* pServer);
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
Here a pointer to the server control object is passed to the class
factory. Think about where this pointer came from in the first place. One
clue is in the call to the class factory constructor (see above in
function DllGetClassObject). Here's the line for CFCar:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  pCob = new CFCar(NULL, g_pServer);
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
The value is passed as global variable g_pServer. This value in turn is
assigned during execution of the DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH case in DllMain, where
the server control object is created. (DllMain is in DLLSERVE.CPP.)

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  g_pServer = new CServer;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
This pointer value to the server control object must also be passed to
the CFCar's IClassFactory implementation through its constructor.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  CImpIClassFactory(
    CFCar* pBackObj,
    IUnknown* pUnkOuter,
    CServer* pServer);
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
As with the pBackObj and pUnkOuter pointers, the pServer pointer is
passed so the methods inside the protected scope of the interface
implementation can access the outside server control object. Both the
CFCar COM object and its implementation of IClassFactory have m_pServer
pointer members to store this value when it is passed by the constructors.
The constructor method implementations have appropriate assignments, such
as the following from the CFCar constructor (in FACTORY.CPP).

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  // Init the pointer to the server control object.
  m_pServer = pServer;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
The class factory, in turn, passes the pointer to any new COM objects
that it creates. To see this, you have to switch over to the IClassFactory
interface implementation in FACTORY.CPP. For example, from the CFCar
implementation of IClassFactory, here is method
CFCar::CImpIClassFactory::CreatInstance:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP CFCar::CImpIClassFactory::CreateInstance(
                 IUnknown* pUnkOuter,
                 REFIID riid,
                 PPVOID ppv)
  {
    HRESULT hr = E_FAIL;
    COCar* pCob = NULL;

    // NULL the output pointer.
    *ppv = NULL;

    // If the creation call is requesting aggregation (pUnkOuter != NULL),
    // the COM rules state that the IUnknown interface MUST also be
    // requested concomitantly. If it is not so requested
    // (riid != IID_IUnknown), then an error must be returned indicating
    // that no aggregate creation of the CFCar COM Object can be
    // performed.
    if (NULL != pUnkOuter &amp;&amp; riid != IID_IUnknown)
      hr = CLASS_E_NOAGGREGATION;
    else
    {
      // Instantiate a COCar COM Object.
      pCob = new COCar(pUnkOuter, m_pServer);
      if (NULL != pCob)
      {
        // We initially created the new COM object so tell the server
        // to increment its global server object count to help ensure
        // that the server remains loaded until this partial creation
        // of a component is completed.
        m_pServer-&gt;ObjectsUp();

        // We QueryInterface this new COM Object not only to deposit the
        // main interface pointer to the caller's pointer variable, but to
        // also automatically bump the Reference Count on the new COM
        // Object after handing out this reference to it.
        hr = pCob-&gt;QueryInterface(riid, (PPVOID)ppv);
        if (FAILED(hr))
        {
          m_pServer-&gt;ObjectsDown();
          delete pCob;
        }
      }
      else
        hr = E_OUTOFMEMORY;
    }

    return hr;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
The CreateInstance code above should remind you of the CreateCar function
in COMOBJ. For example, like CreateCar, the CreateInstance function calls
QueryInterface to provide the caller with the requested interface output
pointer (value *ppv) after successfully creating its COM object.

<p>
In terms of m_pServer, the important line is:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  // Instantiate a COCar COM Object.
  pCob = new COCar(pUnkOuter, m_pServer);
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The interface implementation's m_pServer data member is passed to the new
COCar COM object. What will the new COCar COM object do with it? The
primary thing that the newly manufactured COCar object needs to
communicate to the server is when the COCar COM object has been deleted.
This happens when a client of the object releases the last interface
pointer held on the object. The server needs to be informed when one of
its objects is deleted so that the server can unload itself when it is no
longer needed by any clients. This is part of the control responsibility
encapsulated in the CServer server control object. The new COCar object
will use m_pServer to notify the server control object when the COCar
object is being deleted. More on this below.

<P>
CreateInstance (above) uses m_pServer in other ways, as well, such as the
following.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  // We initially created the new COM object so tell the server
  // to increment its global server object count to help ensure
  // that the server remains loaded until this partial creation
  // of a component is completed.
  m_pServer-&gt;ObjectsUp();
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The server control object is responsible for maintaining the server's
object count, among other things. In a way, the server control object
governs the lifetime of the server as a whole. The ObjectsUp method
increments the server's object count, and the ObjectsDown method
decrements the count. After the class factory successfully manufactures a
new COM object of the requested component type, it calls ObjectsUp in the
server control object to increment the server's object count.

<P>
The server control object is an outgrowth of the CDllData object that was
used to encapsulate DLL data in the DLLSKEL and COMOBJ code samples. Now
it takes on greater importance. CServer is declared in SERVER.H and
implemented in SERVER.CPP. Here is the CServer declaration from SERVER.H:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  class CServer
  {
    public:
      CServer(void);
      ~CServer(void);

      void Lock(void);
      void Unlock(void);
      void ObjectsUp(void);
      void ObjectsDown(void);

      // A place to store the handle to loaded instance of this DLL module.
      HINSTANCE m_hDllInst;

      // A place to store a client's parent window.
      HINSTANCE m_hWndParent;

      // A Pointer to a Message Box object.
      CMsgBox* m_pMsgBox;

      // Global DLL Server living Object count.
      LONG m_cObjects;

      // Global DLL Server Client Lock count.
      LONG m_cLocks;
  };
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>The ObjectsUp and ObjectsDown methods take care of incrementing and
decrementing the server's object count. For example, here is the ObjectsDown
method implementation.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  void CServer::ObjectsDown(void)
  {
    InterlockedDecrement((PLONG) &amp;g_pServer-&gt;m_cObjects);

    LOGF1(&quot;S: CServer::ObjectsDown, new cObjects=%i.&quot;, g_pServer-&gt;m_cObjects);

    return;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
ObjectsUp and ObjectsDown call the Win32 functions InterlockedIncrement
and InterlockedDecrement, respectively. Because the server exists and has
clients in a multitasking environment, the server's object count must be
accessed in ways that guarantee mutual exclusion among contending tasks
(or threads within the same client process). These Win32 functions
guarantee this mutual exclusion for the increment and decrement
operations. The Lock and Unlock methods use the same functions to perform
increment and decrement operations on a global server lock count. These
lock methods are called by the IClassFactory::LockServer method
implementation when a client needs to lock the server in a loaded state,
regardless of whether the server has a zero object count.

<P>
This server is unloaded through the DllCanUnloadNow function that all COM
servers must implement and export. Returning to file DLLSERVE.CPP, here is
DllCanUnloadNow.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDAPI DllCanUnloadNow(void)
  {
    HRESULT hr;

    LOGF1(&quot;S: DllCanUnloadNow. cObjects=%i.&quot;, g_pServer-&gt;m_cObjects);

    // We return S_OK if there are no longer any living objects AND
    // there are no outstanding client locks on this server.
    hr = (0L==g_pServer-&gt;m_cObjects &amp;&amp; 0L==g_pServer-&gt;m_cLocks) ? S_OK : S_FALSE;

    return hr;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This function is occasionally called by COM, usually when the client calls
CoFreeUnusedLibraries, to ask the server if COM can unload it. The server
gives the OK on return from this function if both the lock count and the
object count are zero. Though encapsulated in the CServer object, these
counts are global to the attached process associated with a client
instance and its use of the server. It is not necessary to place these
count variables in a shared section to make them global to all client
processes, because DllCanUnloadNow can be called only in the context of
the CoInitialize/CoUninitialize matching pair of a given client process.
The system maintains process-global usage counts for DLLs, and there is no
need for COM servers to manage this.

<P>
As was pointed out earlier, CFCar is a component in its own right. But
unlike the other applications components managed by the server, it is also
part of what makes the server a server. In the CFCar::Release method
implementation, notice that m_pServer->ObjectsDown is called when the
client releases its pointer to the class factory.

<P>
In the COMOBJ and COMUSER samples, we used a direct DLL call to connect
the DLL to the EXE user of the DLL so that the sample's trace logging
could be integrated in one display. But with DLLSERVE, the client
accesses services in the DLL server solely through interfaces. To provide
a clean model of client/server separation, we have no direct
(DLL-exported) call that the client can make to pass a pointer to its
logging facility into the server.

<P>
There is always power in such indirection. By isolating the client from
direct linkage to the server, the way is open for the servers to reside on
other machines. By making a component, we use an abstraction agency
between the client and the component in the server. This agency is a
cooperative effort between COM and the server.

<P>
Now consider another component that is also part of the infastructure of
this server. In this server code sample, we use a new custom interface
(ISample) and implement it in a CarSample component. Though its purpose
is administratively mundane, it is representative of situations we all
face in developing real applications.

<P>
ISample is declared in ICARS.H, in the sibling \INC directory, and has two
methods: Init and AboutBox. Init is the significant one for associating
the client's logging display with the logging being done in the server.
This method yields an integrated display in the client that shows the
internal sequential behavior in both server and client. This logging
scheme was used to good effect in the prior lessons. Those lessons also
had separate About dialog boxes in the resources of each DLL. This may
seem odd in one sense, but the dialog box doesn't have to be an AboutBox
as such: DLLs might often need to supply dialog boxes to an application. A
banking application, for example, might call on a component in a DLL to
display a dialog box containing a loan application form. The AboutBox is
just an excuse to put a dialog box in the DLL. The ISample implementation
in the CarSample component provides an interface method through which the
client can invoke the dialog box in the server.

<P>
The COCarSample COM object is declared in SAMPLE.H and implemented in the
SAMPLE.CPP file. Once again, the object's multiple interfaces, IUnknown
and a native implementation of ISample, are nested classes.

<P>
The other COM objects provided by DLLSERVE are COCar, COUtilityCar, and
COCruiseCar. They retain their COM object construction characteristics.
COCar (in CAR.H and CAR.CPP) has nested implementations of IUnknown with a
native ICar interface. COUtilityCar (in UTILCAR.H and UTILCAR.CPP) has
nested implementations of IUnknown with two other interfaces, ICar and
IUtility, which are reused by containment. COCruiseCar (in CRUCAR.H and
CRUCAR.CPP) has nested implementations of IUnknown with two other
interfaces, ICar and ICruise, which are reused by aggregation. We'll tour
COCruiseCar as a representative example.

<P>
The COCruiseCar COM object class declaration in CRUCAR.H is a little
different from the declaration in the COMOBJ code sample. These
differences associate the COM object with the server housing and help make
the COM object a properly constructed instance of the CLSID_DllCruiseCar
class of components. Here is the COCruiseCar COM object class declaration:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">

      // Pointer to this component server's control object.
      CServer*        m_pServer;
  };
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The COM object has to be able to inform the server when the object is
being deleted. It does so by storing a pointer to the server's control
object, declared as CServer* m_pServer above. This value is passed to the
constructor and assigned in the constructor implementation. Earlier in
this tour, we saw how this value was passed to the class factory. When
the class factory for COCruiseCar creates a new COCruiseCar COM object, it
passes a copy of this m_pServer pointer to the constructor of the new
COCruiseCar object.

<P>
There is no need, as there was in the interface implementations of the
class factory COM objects, to pass this m_pServer value to COCruiseCar's
other interface implementations (ImpICar and ImpICruise). They simply
don't need it. The pointer is needed only in the COCruiseCar object's
IUnknown, where the object's lifetime is managed. The Release method of
the COCruiseCar object's IUnknown uses m_pServer as follows:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP_(ULONG) COCruiseCar::Release(void)
  {
    ULONG ulCount = --m_cRefs;

    LOGF1(&quot;S: COCruiseCar::Release. New Count=%i.&quot;, m_cRefs);

    if (0 == m_cRefs)
    {
      // We've reached a zero reference count for this COM object.
      // So we tell the server housing to decrement its global object
      // count so that the server will be unloaded if appropriate.
      if (NULL != m_pServer)
        m_pServer-&gt;ObjectsDown();

      // We artificially bump the main ref count. This fulfills one of
      // the rules of aggregated objects and ensures that an indirect
      // recursive call to this release won't occur because of other
      // delegating releases that might happen in our own destructor.
      m_cRefs++;
      delete this;
    }

    return ulCount;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
When the reference count of this COM object goes to zero,
m_pServer->ObjectsDown is called to inform the server. If there are no
more objects for the server (m_cObjects == 0) and no clients have
outstanding locks on the server as a result of calls to
IClassFactory::LockServer, the next call to DllCanUnloadNow will cause COM
to unload the server.

<P>
Another thing to notice in this lesson is the COCruiseCar::Init method.
In COMOBJ we saw that there was an Init method to create any subordinate
COM objects. In the class factory for COCruiseCar components
(CFCruiseCar's CreateInstance method implementation in FACTORY.CPP), this
Init method is called just after a new COCruiseCar object is created.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">

      // of a component is completed.
      m_pServer-&gt;ObjectsUp();

      // If we have succeeded in instantiating the COM object we
      // initialize it to set up any subordinate objects.
      hr = pCob-&gt;Init();
      if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
      {
        // We QueryInterface this new COM Object not only to deposit the
        // main interface pointer to the caller's pointer variable, but to

      }
    }
    else
      hr = E_OUTOFMEMORY;
    ...
    ...
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The ObjectsUp call is made before the call to Init. This is to keep the
server loaded (by incrementing its object count) while the composite
object creation is completed. Init could take some time, and we wouldn't
want another client releasing the last interface on a server-managed
object, causing COM to prematurely unload the server.

<P>
This code guards against something that is extremely unlikely in this code
sample because the class factory component itself resides in the same
server. In order to call CreateInstance, the client must be holding an
interface pointer to the class factory. Since the class factory is
itself a component, the server's object count will be nonzero, at least
until the client releases this pointer to the class factory. There is
nothing wrong, however, with writing foolproof code, and in other
application coding contexts it is at least conceivable that a class
factory component might reside in a different server from the components
it creates.

<P>
Back in CRUCAR.CPP, here is the COCruiseCar::Init method:

<P>
We don't just use a &quot;new COCar&quot; statement to create the
subordinate COCar COM object. COCar is a component in its own right, and
rather than assuming any special knowledge about its availability inside
this server, we use the general power of COM to find the right server and
create the object. Our code is not hard-wired to require that all
CLSID_DllCar components be managed by the same server. We are going to
make a new COCruiseCar COM Object and aggregate a new COCar object to do
it. We don't care where the new COCar is or where it comes from; it might
even be on another machine. We only want COM to give back a pointer to the
object's IUnknown.

<P>
CoCreateInstance is a COM service that accepts a CLSID for a component
type and creates a single instance of it. CoCreateInstance encapsulates
the following behavior:

<ol>
<li>Locates and loads the appropriate server.

<li>Obtains a pointer to the appropriate class factory.

<li>Requests that the class factory create an instance of the component.

<li>Releases the class factory interface pointer.

<li>Returns a pointer to the requested interface in the location specified
(in the sample code above, by the &amp;m_pUnkCar parameter).

</ol>

<P>
This COM API &quot;helper&quot; function is useful when you need a single
instance of a given component type.
