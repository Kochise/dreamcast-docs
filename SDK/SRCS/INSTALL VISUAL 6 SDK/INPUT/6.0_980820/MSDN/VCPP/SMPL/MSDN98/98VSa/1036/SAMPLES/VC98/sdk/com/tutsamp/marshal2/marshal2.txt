MARSHAL2 - Self-Registration of Standard Marshaling Servers


SUMMARY
=======

The MARSHAL2 sample shows an alternate and more advanced technique for
building a proxy/stub marshaling DLL for the ICar, IUtility, and ICruise
custom interfaces. The previous MARSHAL sample illustrated the system
default method of producing the marshaling DLL. That method controlled the
conditional compilation of the DLLDATA.C file to generate default
definitions for the DllMain, DllRegisterServer, and DllUnregisterServer
functions in the DLL. WMARSHAL2 does not generate these default functions.
Instead, they coded explicitly.  Thus, this lesson has more detail on the
content of these functions.

Although the default definitions of these functions are adequate for most
programming, there may be occasions when you want more control over the
content of the marshaling DLL. For example, you might want to perform some
action within DllMain during DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, you might want to code
explicit control over the registration and unregistration of the
marshaling server, or you might want to add standard module version
information to the DLL resources. This sample covers these areas.

As in the MARSHAL sample, the Microsoft Interface Definition Language
compiler (MIDL.EXE) is used to compile the interface definitions
(expressed using the MIDL language in the MICARS.IDL file). MIDL.EXE is a
utility provided as part of the Microsoft Platform Software Development
Kit (SDK). The MIDL compilation of MICARS.IDL generates additional source
files: MICARS.H, MICARS_I.C, MICARS_P.C, and DLLDATA.C.

In the series of COM Tutorial code samples, MARSHAL2 is an alternate
marshaling DLL that can replace MARSHAL.DLL produced in the MARSHAL sample
and can work with later samples in the series to provide standard
marshaling for the custom ICar, IUtility, and ICruise interfaces. To
achieve this, just register MARSHAL2.DLL. This will override any previous
registration of MARSHAL.DLL. Since both of these DLLs provide proxy/stub
marshaling for the same interfaces, the one registered most recently will
replace the other if it is registered.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of MARSHAL2, see the
Code Tour section in MARSHAL2.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of MARSHAL2, see the Usage section in MARSHAL2.HTM. To
read MARSHAL2.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the MARSHAL2 lesson in the table of lessons. You can also do the
same thing by double-clicking the MARSHAL2.HTM file after locating the
main tutorial directory in Windows Explorer. For a simpler way to provide
the same standard marshaling functionality that MARHSAL2 provides, see
MARSHAL.HTM.

The subsequent samples in the series that require marshaling of the ICar,
IUtility, and ICruise interfaces normally rely on the registration of
MARSHAL.DLL as the marshaling DLL. MARSHAL.DLL is produced in the previous
MARSHAL sample. MARSHAL2's makefile does not automatically register
MARSHAL2.DLL as the marshaling DLL for those car-related interfaces.
However, this registration can be enabled in MARSHAL2's makefile by
uncommenting the appropriate lines. Registering MARSHAL2 will replace any
prior registration of MARSHAL.DLL. Although, these two marshaling DLLs are
functionally equivalent, there are subtle differences in how they perform
their self-registration. For more details on how MARSHAL2.DLL performs
self-registration see below.

If enabled in the makefile, MARSHAL2's self-registration is done using the
REGISTER.EXE utility built in the REGISTER sample. To build or run
MARSHAL2, you should build the REGISTER code sample first.

For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.


Usage
-----

MARSHAL2 is a DLL that is built solely as a marshaling DLL for the
specified interfaces. Although it can be implicitly loaded by linking to
its associated .LIB file, it is normally used on behalf of a COM client
that functions the server across apartment, process, or machine
boundaries. COM loads this DLL automatically in these situations. Before
COM can find and load MARSHAL2.DLL to support marshaling of its supported
interfaces, the MARSHAL2 server must be registered in the registry as the
marshaling server for those interfaces. MARSHAL2 is a self-registering
in-process server. If enabled (see above), the makefile that builds this
sample automatically registers the server in the registry. You can
manually initiate its self-registration by issuing the following command
at the command prompt in the MARSHAL2 directory:

  nmake register

This assumes that you have a compilation environment set up. If not, you
can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the MARSHAL2 directory.

  ..\register\register.exe marshal2.dll

These registration commands require a prior build of both the REGISTER
sample and the MARSHAL2 sample.

In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Microsoft Platform SDK and Visual
C++ include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which can be used in a similar
fashion to register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.
