<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
The DCOMDRAW, DCDSERVE, and DCDMARSH samples together form a distributed
drawing application. Using Distributed COM (DCOM) technology, they allow
users on different client machines in a network to interactively draw on a
shared drawing. All DCOMDRAW clients see the same drawing and any client
can take ownership of the pen to draw. The user of DCOMDRAW can use a
mouse or tablet device to draw in the client window and can choose the
color and width of the electronic ink. As clients draw, the application
echoes the drawing activity from DCDSERVE to all connected clients using
DCOM over the network. Although these samples do not build an optimized
and complete application, the functionality is suggestive of the shared
whiteboards offered by some workgroup applications.

<P>
Although DCOMDRAW, DCDSERVE, and DCDMARSH work on the same machine across
process boundaries, the main goal is to provide a distributed application
that enables multiple DCOMDRAW clients on different machines to access a
single shared drawing object housed in a DCDSERVE server running on a
common server machine. A typical scenario would have numerous client
machines hooked to an intranet consisting of a Windows NT network domain
or peer-to-peer workgroup. DCOMDRAW can run on any of these client
machines. DCDSERVE is installed and runs on a common server machine in the
domain. The user of the DCOMDRAW client can interactively choose the
remote server machine to determine which DCDSERVE COM server to use for
the shared drawing.

<P>
DCDSERVE manages a shared, single COPaper COM object that models a sheet
of white drawing paper. Clients can use the methods of the COPaper object
to draw on the paper surface using &quot;ink&quot; of specified color and
width. This functionality is outwardly similar to the &quot;scribble&quot;
tutorial samples in many versions of the Microsoft Visual C++&reg;
product. The drawing paper features of COPaper objects are exposed to
DCOMDRAW clients by a custom ISharePaper interface. COPaper implements the
ISharePaper interface. A clear architectural distinction is kept between
client and server. No graphical user interface (GUI) is provided by the
COPaper object. It relies on the DCOMDRAW client for all GUI behavior.
COPaper encapsulates only the server-based capture and storage of the
drawn ink data.

<p>
The ink data that is drawn on the COPaper surface can be stored in and
loaded from compound files. The ISharePaper::Save and ISharePaper::Load
method implementations in COPaper use structured storage to store the
current data of the shared drawing in a compound file kept with
DCDSERVE.EXE on the machine acting as the common server.

<P>
The DCOMDRAW sample creates and uses the connectable COPaper COM object
that is provided as the CLSID_SharePaper component in the DCDSERVE server.
The DCOMDRAW client creates a COPaper object and controls it using the
methods of the ISharePaper interface. DCOMDRAW obtains drawing data from
the user and displays that data in a window that it manages. DCOMDRAW uses
COPaper's ISharePaper interface to save the drawing data in COPaper and to
direct file-storage operations on this data.

<P>
COPaper only manages the drawing data; it performs no GUI actions.
DCOMDRAW provides the GUI for the drawing application by encapsulating
this functionality in a central CGuiPaper C++ object.

<P>
DCOMDRAW also implements the custom IPaperSink interface on a COPaperSink
COM object and connects this interface to an appropriate connection point
on the COPaper object in DCDSERVE. COPaper uses the connected IPaperSink
interface to send notifications back to the COPaperSink in DCOMDRAW. The
normal GUI repainting of COPaper's drawing data is done in DCOMDRAW using
COPaper's connectable object technology. Thus in this sample, COM's
connectable-object technology uses DCOM to function transparently across
the network. In earlier samples such as STOCLIEN and STOSERVE, COM's
connectable-object technology was shown operating only in-process.

<p>
The two ISharePaper and IPaperSink custom interfaces are declared in
PAPINT.H, which is located in the common INC directory. PAPINT.H is
automatically generated in the DCDMARSH sample. The GUIDs for the
interfaces and objects are defined in PAPGUIDS.H located in that same
directory.

<P>
This lesson focuses primarily on how to take care of DCOM process security
on the client side and how to load a remote object using DCOM. Using
CoInitializeSecurity to set process security is covered.
CoCreateInstanceEx using the MULTI_QI structure is covered.

<P>
Because client and server run in separate processes--usually on different
computers--both DCDSERVE and DCOMDRAW rely on standard marshaling for the
ISharePaper and IPaperSink custom interfaces. The DCDMARSH sample provides
this support, so you must build (or otherwise register) DCDMARSH.DLL on
both machines prior to building and running DCDSERVE and DCOMDRAW across
machines.

<P>
To set a DCOMDRAW client on one machine to control the common DCDSERVE
server on another, both machines must have DCOM (Distributed COM)
installed. DCOM is included in Windows NT 4.0 or above and in Windows 98.
If a computer is running Windows 95, you must install the DCOM95 add on.
DCOM95 can currently be obtained by download from Microsoft's world wide
Web site at:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/com/" target="_blank">
http://www.microsoft.com/com/</a>.

<P>
The multiple computers must be connected in a properly configured network.
For details on setting up a network, see your Windows NT product
documentation or the Windows NT Resource Kit. For more details on computer
and network setup for running with DCOM, see the &quot;Network and Setup
Issues&quot; section at the end of the REMCLIEN lesson. Note that the less
restrictive security in Windows 95 and Windows 98 prevents the SCM under
DCOM from automatically launching DCDSERVE on behalf of a remote DCOMDRAW
client. You must manually pre-launch DCDSERVE on these operating systems
if you attempt a remote load of DCDSERVE from a DCOMDRAW running on
another machine. The DCDSERVE and DCOMDRAW lessons assume that you install
DCDSERVE on a machine running Windows NT Server or Workstation.

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of DCOMDRAW, see the
Code Tour section in DCOMDRAW.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of DCOMDRAW, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
DCOMDRAW.HTM. To read DCOMDRAW.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the DCOMDRAW lesson in the table of lessons. You can
do the same thing by locating the main tutorial directory in the Windows
Explorer and double-clicking the DCOMDRAW.HTM file. For more details on
how DCDSERVE works and exposes its services to DCOMDRAW, see DCDSERVE.HTM
in the main tutorial directory. The makefile for DCDSERVE automatically
registers that server in the registry of the host machine, so you must
build DCDSERVE on the remote machine before attempting to run DCOMDRAW.

<P>
For general details on setting up your system to build and test Win32 code
samples such as those in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM.
The supplied MAKEFILE is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug
build, issue the NMAKE command in the command-prompt window.

<h4>Usage</h4>

<P>
DCOMDRAW is an application that you can execute directly from Windows or
from the command-prompt window. No command-line parameters are recognized
by DCOMDRAW. DCOMDRAW currently runs on the Windows 95 operating system
with the DCOM95 update for Windows 95 installed. It will run on Windows 98
which includes DCOM. It will also run under version 4 or later of Windows
NT Workstation or Windows NT Server.

<h4>Run the Sample</h4>

<p>
The DCDSERVE, DCDMARSH, and DCOMDRAW samples must be compiled before you
can run the client. For more details on building the samples, see
<a href="using.htm#building">Building the Code Samples.</a>

<P>
To access and control the remote DCDSERVE server, the DCOMDRAW client
requires that you have your network and machines set up
properly for DCOM operation. See the &quot;Network Setup and Issues&quot;
section of the REMCLIEN lesson for more details. If you have already built
the appropriate samples and set up your machines for DCOM operation,
DCOMDRAW.EXE is the client executable to run for this sample.

<a href="DCOMDRAW\DCOMDRAW.exe">Click here to run DCOMDRAW.EXE.</a>

<P>
Depending on the security level of your browser you may see a dialog box
prompting you to either open the .EXE file or save it to disk. Select the
"Open it" radio button and then click the OK button.

<p>&#160;
<h3>OPERATION</h3>

<P>
The DCOMDRAW.EXE application provides the user interface for this sample
application. It uses the functionality of the associated, but independent,
DCDSERVE.EXE out-of-process server. Here is a summary of operation from
the standpoint of DCOMDRAW.EXE as a client of DCDSERVE.EXE.

<P>
Since two machines are involved in this lesson, this lesson refers to the
machine where DCDSERVE runs as Machine-S (server) and to the machine where
DCOMDRAW runs as Machine-C (client).

<P>
The are many ways to set up to build and run DCOMDRAW for this tutorial.
Here are two alternate ways to get started:

<ol>
  <li>Set up Machine-S (running Windows NT 4.0) to compile Win32
      applications. Run MAKEALL.BAT to compile all of the COM tutorial
      code samples there. Among other things, this build process registers
      the necessary interfaces in the registry on Machine-S for standard
      marshaling using the DCDMARSH marshaling server on that machine.
      Using the drive share predefined as C$ on Machine-S, copy a complete
      copy of the compiled \MSSDK\SAMPLES\COM\TUTSAMP branch across the
      network from Machine-S to Machine-C. With all the sample executables
      on Machine-C (running Windows NT 4.0), run the REGALL batch file in
      the TUTSAMP directory on Machine-C. This registers the DCDSERVE
      server and its interfaces in the registry on Machine-C. The DCDMARSH
      standard marshaling server located on that machine is used to
      register the interfaces there.</li>

  <li>Set up both Machine-S and Machine-C (perhaps with Machine-S running
      Windows NT 5.0 and Machine-C running Windows 98). Copy the
      uncompiled source of the samples branch from Machine-S to Machine-C.
      Then run MAKEALL.BAT on both machines. This will perform a complete
      build of all the executables and automatically register the DCDSERVE
      and DCDMARSH servers on both machines.</li>
</ol>

<P>
Once registered, DCDSERVE server requires manual security configuration
using the DCOMCNFG utility. For more details, see
<a href="dcdserve.htm#Installing">&quot;Installing DCDSERVE&quot;</a>
in the DCDSERVE.HTM file.

<P>
With the executables present and the servers properly registered on both
machines, you can run the DCOMDRAW application on Machine-C, relying on
COM to locate and load the remote DCDSERVE server on Machine-S. DCOMDRAW
provides a Load from Remote Server dialog box in which you can enter the
name of the remote machine on which the DCDSERVE server runs.

<P>
DCOMDRAW.EXE provides menus for loading and saving the shared drawing and
for controlling the drawing pen color and width. The following menus are
provided:

<p>Menu Selection: File/Load Remote...<br>
Displays the Load from Remote Server dialog box, in which you specify the
network machine name of the computer where the remote DCDSERVE server is
located and registered. DCOM recognizes machine names that are in a valid
UNC format (for example, Machine-S or \\Machine-S), a DNS format (for
example, www.mymachine.com), or an IP address format (for example,
123.45.6.7).

<p>Menu Selection: File/Load Local<br>
Loads (or reloads) the drawing from a DCDSERVE registered on the local
machine (that is, the machine where this client is running).

<p>Menu Selection: File/Save<br>
Saves the current drawing. Beeps if this DCOMDRAW does not own the pen.

<p>Menu Selection: File/Exit<br>
Exits DCOMDRAW.

<p>Menu Selection: Draw/Take Pen<br>
Takes ownership of the pen to permit this DCOMDRAW to draw on the shared
drawing. Beeps if another client already owns the pen.

<p>Menu Selection: Draw/Give Pen<br>
Relinquishes ownership of the pen to permit any other DCOMDRAW client to
take the pen draw on the shared drawing.

<p>Menu Selection: Draw/Redraw<br>
Forces a redraw of the current DCOMDRAW client's display of the shared
drawing.

<p>Menu Selection: Draw/Erase<br>
Erases all content of the currently shared drawing. Beeps if this DCOMDRAW
client does not own the pen.

<p>Menu Selection: Color<br>
Shows the Pick Color dialog allowing you to choose the current color of
the drawing pen. Beeps if this DCOMDRAW client does not own the pen.

<p>Menu Selection: Thin<br>
Sets current pen width to Thin. Beeps if this DCOMDRAW client does not own
the pen.

<p>Menu Selection: Medium<br>
Sets current pen width to Medium. Beeps if this DCOMDRAW client does not own
the pen.

<p>Menu Selection: Fat<br>
Sets current pen width to Fat. Beeps if this DCOMDRAW client does not own
the pen.

<P>Menu Selection: Help/DCOMDRAW Tutorial<br>
Opens the DCOMDRAW.HTM tutorial file in the Web browser.

<P>Menu Selection: Help/DCDSERVE Tutorial<br>
Opens the DCDSERVE.HTM tutorial file in the Web browser.

<P>Menu Selection: Help/DCDMARSH Tutorial<br>
Opens the DCDMARSH.HTM tutorial file in the Web browser.

<p>Menu Selection: Help/Read Source File<br>
Displays the Open common dialog box so you can open a source file from this
lesson or another one in the Windows Notepad.

<p>Menu Selection: Help/About DCOMDRAW<br>
Displays the About dialog box for this application, a standard part of
this series of code samples. The code illustrates how to use the CAboutBox
class provided by APPUTIL.LIB.

<P>
When first run on a machine, DCOMDRAW loads a shared drawing from the
DCDSERVE registered on the local machine. That first instance of DCOMDRAW
is given &quot;master&quot; ownership of the drawing pen. This means that
it can immediately make drawing changes to the drawing. Any subsequent
instances of DCOMDRAW on that same machine will access the same locally
shared drawing, but will not own the pen. This means that they cannot draw
and may merely see drawing activity as it is done in the DCOMDRAW client
that owns the pen. The pen cursor changes to an 'X' indicating that the
pen is not owned and that drawing is off. When drawing is on, the pen
cursor size changes (that is, a thin, medium, or fat pen) to indicate the
chosen pen width. The DCOMDRAW title bar also has an indicator of pen
ownership. If DCOMDRAW owns the pen, &quot;***TALK***&quot; appears in the
title bar. If the client does not own the pen, &quot;LISTEN&quot; appears
in the title bar. The usage model here assumes that while users are
sharing the drawing they are also talking over some audio channel
(possibly telephone). Typically, when a client user is drawing they are
talking to explain it; otherwise the client user con only watch another
client's drawing activity.

<P>
When you own the pen in DCOMDRAW, you press and hold the left mouse button
as you move the mouse to draw ink.

<P>
The File/Load Remote menu choice allows you to load or connect to a shared
drawing maintained on a remote machine. If multiple clients on different
client machines load from that same remote machine then they will all
share the same drawing maintained by the DCDSERVE registered on that
server machine.

<P>
Like all code samples in the series, DCOMDRAW uses many of the utility
classes and services provided by APPUTIL. For more details on APPUTIL,
study the APPUTIL library source code in the APPUTIL directory and the
lesson in the APPUTIL.HTM file in the main tutorial directory.

<P>
DCOMDRAW requires DCOM. Early in its WinMain function, DCOMDRAW calls
APPUTIL's DComOk function to confirm that DCOM is installed on the system.
DComOk does this by ensuring that the CoInitializeEx function is exported
from the OLE32.DLL system library. CoInitializeEx was initially supplied
with the DCOM functionality in Windows NT 4.0 and its presence is thus a
simple way to confirm that DCOM is present. Similarly, DComOk will return
FALSE on Windows 95 if the DCOM95 add-on is not installed.

<P>
DCOMDRAW and DCDSERVE borrow much from the STOCLIEN and STOSERVE samples.
As a result, this lesson does not discuss in detail how CGuiPaper
encapsulates the GUI behavior of drawing paper, how the interactive mouse
activity is captured and displayed, how COPaper records the drawing data,
how IPaperSink and the connectable-object technology works, and how the
drawing data is actually stored in the structured storage of a compound
file. For more details on these topics, see the STOCLIEN/STOSERVE lessons
for more details on these topics.

<P>
The major topics covered in this code tour are:

<ul>
<li>How DCOMDRAW establishes its process security context to use
    DCOM with a remote server.</li>

<li>How DCOMDRAW loads the remote COPaper drawing.</li>

<li>How DCOMDRAW paints the remote COPaper drawing.</li>
</ul>

<P>
The DCOMDRAW sample relies heavily on COM's connectable-object technology
for communication from COPaper back to the client. Interactive drawing as
well as on-demand re-painting use this technology. In particular, COPaper
calls the methods of an IPaperSink interface on a COPaperSink object in
DCOMDRAW. For DCOM to carry these calls across the network you must take
care of some security issues. We saw in the DCDSERVE lesson that its
process is acting under the identity of a DCOMDraw user. We explicitly
created that user account when installing DCDSERVE. Unless we create an
account for this specific user on every client machine with the proper
permissions, this DCOMDraw identity in the server will not have
permissions to call back into (or otherwise access) DCOMDRAW on the client
side. So a technique is needed to permit this access into the client from
an outside identity.

<P>
A call to CoInitializeSecurity grants this access for the entire DCOMDRAW
client process. The call establishes a security context in the client that
permits COPaper on the server side to call back into DCOMDRAW on the
client side. Here is such a CoInitializeSecurity call in a code fragment
from the WinMain function in DCOMDRAW.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  ...
  ...
  // If we were compiled for UNICODE and the platform seems OK with this
  // then proceed.  Else we error and exit the app.
  if (UnicodeOk())
  {
    // Call to initialize the COM Library.  Use the SUCCEEDED macro
    // to detect success.  If fail then exit app with error message.
    // Tell COM that this client process will use the Single Threaded
    // Apartment model.
    if (SUCCEEDED(CoInitialize(NULL)))
    {
      // Ensure that DCOM (Distributed COM) is installed.
      if (DComOk())
      {
        // Initialize for Client process security. Allow COPaper to
        // call back into the client (ie, the client can impersonate
        // the server identity).
        hr = CoInitializeSecurity(
               NULL,                        //Points to security descriptor
               -1,                          //Count of entries in asAuthSvc
               NULL,                        //Array of names to register
               NULL,                        //Reserved for future use
               RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_NONE,      //Default authentication level
                                            // for proxies
               RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE, //Default impersonation level
                                            // for proxies

               NULL);                       //Reserved for future use
        if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
        {
          ...
          ...
          Initialize the client app and run the main message loop.
          ...
          ...
        }
        else
          Error: Can't initialize security.
      }
      else
        Error: DCOM is not installed.

      // We're exiting this app (either normally or by init failure) so
      // shut down the COM Library.
      CoUninitialize();
    }
    else
      Error: Can't initialize COM.
  }
  else
    Error: Platform Can't handle UNICODE.
  ...
  ...
</FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The above CoInitializeSecurity call should look familiar because it is
identical to the one used in the DCDSERVE sample. See DCDSERVE.HTM where
this call is covered in detail. In DCOMDRAW the call to
CoInitializeSecurity shown above establishes a process security context in
which call backs are not authenticated (that is, they are allowed to pass)
and the calling identity (the DCOMDraw user) is impersonated in the
client. This essentially opens the security door in this sample client.
You can also use CoInitializeSecurity to create a more restrictive
arrangement. For example, a non-NULL security descriptor could be passed
as the first parameter. It could include a DACL (Discretionary Access
Control List) that specifically grants permission to only the DCOMDraw
user. Although this sample does not use them, there are also techniques
whereby restricted security contexts can be established for the duration
of individual interface method calls.

<P>
When you run DCOMDRAW it initially loads the drawing from a COPaper that is
available from a DCDSERVE server that is registered on the local machine.
At this point DCOMDRAW is a simple local drawing application. The drawing
you make is stored in the DCDSERVE.PAP compound file located with the
DCDSERVE on the local machine. If you run multiple instances of DCOMDRAW
on this machine, they will all share that local drawing.

<P>
By choosing the File/Load Remote command you can enter the machine name
for the remote drawing to be shared. The existing local drawing is then
closed and a drawing is loaded into a COPaper running on the remote server
machine. (Of course, this assumes that the remote machine is set up with
DCDSERVE installed as described in the DCDSERVE lesson.) The REMCLIEN
lesson also covered using CoCreateInstanceEx and a COSERVERINFO structure
DCOMDRAW uses the same technique. Here is the CGuiPaper::LoadRemote method
from GUIPAPER.CPP:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  HRESULT CGuiPaper::LoadRemote(void)
  {
    HRESULT hr = NOERROR;

             MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDD_LOAD_REMOTE),
             m_hWnd);

The CoCreateInstanceEx call uses the MULTI_QI structure even though only
one interface is requested. This facility is especially useful in the
context of DCOM where numerous interfaces on a remote object are needed by
a client. Rather than suffer the overhead of separate QueryInterface
round-trips across the network, this facility allows more than one
interface to be obtained in one CoCreateInstanceEx call.

<P>
After obtaining the m_pISharePaper interface pointer, it is used to call
the InitPaper method. This call returns the window rectangle of the remote
drawing and also a flag that indicates whether this is the first client to
gain access to the newly created COPaper.

<P>
If this is the first client then an initial lock on the shared COPaper
drawing is requested. This lock means that this first client owns the pen.
COPaper is then asked to load the drawing content from its associated
compound file. This is the DCDSERVE.PAP file located on the remote machine
with DCDSERVE.

<P>
If this client is not the first client, then it does not request a lock on
COPaper because it is assumed that an earlier client owns the pen. Since a
COPaper object already exists and is loaded, this client resizes its
window to match the existing drawing used by the other clients. In
addition to drawing something, one of these earlier clients may have
resized the drawing window. Finally, the drawing is painted in the
client's window whether this client is the first or not.

<P>
Since the drawing data for the shared drawing is managed by a single
instance of COPaper on the server side, DCOMDRAW must obtain this data
from COPaper to display the drawing. Here is the CGuiPaper::PaintWin
method from GUIPAPER.CPP.

<P>
The DCOMDRAW client plays an active role in getting the ink data for
painting. Compare this to the repainting in the STOCLIEN sample. In that
sample the client would request a redraw of the COPaper object. COPaper
would then loop to send the data back to a sink in the client. But in this
DCOMDRAW distributed drawing sample, the clients can all concurrently loop
to obtain the data for their own separate repaints. Because both the
DCDSERVE server and the DCOMDRAW client initialize COM in a Single
Threaded Apartment (STA), COM ensures that multiple client calls to the
shared COPaper are serialized on the same thread in DCDSERVE. This
arrangement is convenient to program but can tax performance. For better
performance, COPaper can be coded as a free-threaded object residing in
the Multi-Threaded Apartment (MTA) of DCDSERVE.

<P>
Note that performance of the drawing and repainting in DCOMDRAW can vary
depending on the complexity of your network. For example, during repaints
COPaper in DCDSERVE may be calling COPaperSink in DCOMDRAW through
intermediary servers or from trusted domains to trusting domains. DCOMDRAW
and DCDSERVE are not optimized for maximum performance in these cases. One
worthy optimization would cache individual ink points into collections
called strokes. Each stroke would be a variant blob beginning with an
InkStart and ending with an InkStop. Rather than each individual ink point
being sent separately, strokes would be sent. This would replace the
InkDraw calls that make up the bulk of the repaint traffic with a greatly
reduced number of InkStroke calls. The drawing behavior would look less
smooth but a repaint would be faster.
