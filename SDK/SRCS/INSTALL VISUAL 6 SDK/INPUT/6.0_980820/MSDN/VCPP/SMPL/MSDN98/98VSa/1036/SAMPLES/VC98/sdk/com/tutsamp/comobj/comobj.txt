COMOBJ - COM Objects in a DLL


SUMMARY
=======

This samples introduces COM objects.

An object is a software construct that encapsulates or packages some
data and some public methods that operate on that data.  The data is often
said to be "hidden" while the methods are exposed as the chief means to
access the data.  At compile time, programming languages provide varying
degrees of syntactic support to express objects. For example, the C++
language offers a Class syntactic construct to express an abstract type
(or class) of object. However, this C++ Class construct does allow for
public access to an object's data. An object class is an abstraction that
refers to an open-ended set of potential objects of the same specific
kind. Objects are real things that occupy memory with their data and code
instantiated in live binary form. The 'object' term typically refers to
the runtime behavior of the this real software thing.

A COM object is a kind of object that originated with Microsoft's
Component Object Model (COM). COM objects completely hide their data and
expose their methods through a construct called an interface.  A COM
interface is a grouping of related methods that is uniquely identified for
all programs and all time (by an Interface ID).  Interfaces are used to
encapsulate COM object feature sets.  The most fundamental feature set in
COM gives COM objects their nature as COM objects. The IUnknown interface
exposes this feature set in several methods (AddRef, Release, and
QueryInterface) that determine the common behavior governing all COM
object lifetimes and how interfaces on COM objects are properly acquired.

Outside users of a COM object can only use the object by acquiring one of
its interfaces.  This acquisition of an interface is achieved by obtaining
a pointer to the COM object's implementation of the interface.  COM
objects &quot;know&quot; about the interfaces they expose to clients and
can provide pointer references to the interface implementations. Likewise,
COM objects know about how many interface references they have handed out
to clients and can thus control their own lifetime. When no references
remain, the object normally removes itself from memory and ceases to
exist.

The COMOBJ DLL offers several car-related COM object classes. Because
COMOBJ.DLL supports no object handlers, class factories, full in-process
servers, or marshshaling, it is not a full-blown COM Server. Rather, it is
a primitive precursor to an COM in-process server.

This DLL exposes the following COM objects: COCar, COUtilityCar, and
COCruiseCar. Appropriate create functions are exported from this DLL:
CreateCar, CreateUtilityCar, and CreateCruiseCar.

In this tutorial, COMOBJ works with the COMUSER code sample to show how an
EXE client (COMUSER.EXE) calls COM object creation services and manipulates
the COM objects that are created.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of COMOBJ, see the
Code Tour section in COMOBJ.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of COMOBJ, see the Usage section in COMOBJ.HTM. To read
COMOBJ.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and click the
COMOBJ lesson in the table of lessons. You can also achieve the same thing
by clicking the COMOBJ.HTM file after locating the main tutorial directory
in the Windows Explorer. See also COMUSER.HTM in the main tutorial
directory for more details on the COMUSER client application and how it
works with COMOBJ.DLL itself. You must build COMOBJ.DLL before building
COMUSER. The makefile for COMOBJ copies the necessary COMOBJ.H,
COMOBJ.LIB, and COMOBJ.DLL files to the appropriate sibling directories
once the files are built. The .H goes to \INC, the .LIB goes to \LIB, and
the .DLL goes to \COMUSER.

In general, to set up your system to build and test the code samples in
this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM for details. The supplied
makefile is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the
NMAKE command at the command prompt.

Usage
-----

COMOBJ is a DLL that you can access from .EXE modules either by performing
an explicit LoadLibrary call or implicitly loading the DLL by linking to its
associated import library (.LIB) file. In either case, you need to include
COMOBJ.H to declare the functions that are defined as exported in the COMOBJ
DLL. In this lesson, a representative COMUSER.EXE application is provided
to illustrate the programmatic use of COMOBJ.DLL. COMUSER is built in the
COMUSER lesson (in sibling directory COMUSER). See below for more details.
