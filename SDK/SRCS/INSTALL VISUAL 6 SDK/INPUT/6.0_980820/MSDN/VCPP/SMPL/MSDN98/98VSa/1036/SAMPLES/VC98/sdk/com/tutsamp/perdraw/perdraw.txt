PERDRAW - IPersistStorage Persistent Object Server


SUMMARY
=======

PERDRAW is the third sample in a group of samples that illustrate various
techniques for implementing COM object persistence. The first sample,
PERSERVE, illustrates persistence by implementing the IPersistStream
standard interface. The second sample, PERTEXT, illustrates persistence by
implementing the IPersistStreamInit standard interface. This sample,
PERDRAW, illustrates persistence by implementing the IPersistStorage
standard interface. The fourth sample, PERCLIEN, shows how a client
exploits the kinds of persistence provided by the PERSERVE, PERTEXT, and
PERDRAW server components.

The PERDRAW sample introduces the CODrawPage COM object, which models a
sheet of white drawing paper. CODrawPage objects expose a set of features
for free-form drawing on a virtual surface using "ink" of
specified color and width. CODrawPage is based on the scribble-like
functionality of the COPaper object from the STOSERVE sample.

CODrawPage objects expose a set of interfaces whose methods make the
objects connectable, persistent managers of the drawing data. Clients
access this data through an IDrawPage custom interface exposed by
CODrawPage.

PERDRAW maintains a clear architectural distinction between client and
server. Among other things, CODrawPage provides no graphical user
interface (GUI); instead, the CODrawPage object relies on the client for
all GUI behavior.

The PERCLIEN client provides the GUI display and manages a list of pages,
the contents of which are stored in a compound file that contains both the
contents of the list and of each page in that list. The user of PERCLIEN
can edit the content of two types of pages: text pages and drawing pages.
Text pages have data that the user can edit using a simple windowed text
editor. Drawing pages have drawing data that the user can edit using
free-form, scribble-like functionality based on the earlier STOSERVE and
STOCLIEN samples. Both kinds of editing are done in separate client
windows. For more details see PERCLIEN.HTM.

Storage in the compound file is achieved because the components provide
persistent COM objects that encapsulate the page list and edited page
data. PERSERVE houses a persistent object that encapsulates the single
page list kept in each compound file containing such pages. PERTEXT houses
a persistent object that encapsulates the edited text data for each text
page. PERDRAW houses a persistent object that encapsulates the drawing
data for each drawing page.

The COPageList object in the PERSERVE sample encapsulates the persistent
page list data. COPageList implements the IPersistStream standard
interface to expose control of the page list storage located in the
client-provided stream of a compound file. The COTextPage object in the
previous PERTEXT sample encapsulates the data of an edited text page.
COTextPage implements the IPersistStreamInit standard interface to expose
control of the text data storage that is located in the client-provided
stream of a compound file. In contrast to these stream-based persistent
objects, the CODrawPage object in this PERDRAW sample encapsulates the
persistent drawing-ink data that comprises a drawing. CODrawPage
implements the IPersistStorage standard interface to expose control of the
drawing-ink data storage located in the client-provided substorage of a
compound file.

This code sample focuses primarily on the CODrawPage implementation of the
IPersistStorage interface to provide storage-based persistence for a COM
object. PERDRAW works with the PERCLIEN sample to demonstrate the joint
use by client and server of this IPersistStorage-based persistence.

CODrawPage's support for object persistence is the primary means of
storing the ink data of the drawing page. CODrawPage stores its ink data
in client-provided substorages located in a structured storage compound
file. The compound file has a unique format because of the various streams
and storages used. The client identifies these compound files as page
files with a .PAG file extension. The client controls the use of the
containing compound file and provides CODrawPage with an IStorage pointer
to load and save its drawing data in the compound file. The IStorage
pointer is passed to CODrawPage in calls to the IPersistStorage interface
methods.

CODrawPage also exposes an IDrawPage custom interface to manipulate the
drawing data that is encapsulated by the drawing page. IDrawPage exposes
the InkStart, InkDraw, InkStop, Clear, Resize, and Redraw methods.

CODrawPage also supports connectable object features. It exposes the
IConnectionPointContainer interface, an appropriate connection point is
implemented, and an outgoing custom IDrawPageSink interface is declared to
send notifications to the client.

The two IDrawPage and IDrawPageSink custom interfaces are declared in
IPAGES.H, which is  located in the common INC directory. PAGEGUID.H, which
contains the GUID definitions for the for the interfaces and objects, is
in that same directory.

The PERDRAW sample uses the CThreaded facility in APPUTIL to achieve thread
safety in the server housing and the class factory. Because PERDRAW.DLL is
generally accessed from a Single Threaded Apartment (STA) as an in-process
server, CODrawPage instances are not coded as thread-safe using the
CThreaded facility. The CLSID_DrawPage component is registered as
supporting the apartment threading model.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of the PERDRAW
sample, see the Code Tour section in PERDRAW.HTM. For details on setting
up the programmatic usage of PERDRAW.DLL, see the Usage section in
PERDRAW.HTM. To read PERDRAW.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the PERDRAW lesson in the table of lessons. You can do
the same thing by double-clicking the PERDRAW.HTM file after locating the
main tutorial directory in Windows Explorer. For more details on the
PERCLIEN client application and how it works with PERDRAW.DLL, see
PERCLIEN.HTM in the main tutorial directory. You must build PERDRAW.DLL
before running the PERCLIEN sample.

The PERDRAW server provides a DrawPage component that can create instances
of the CODrawPage COM object. CODrawPage is housed in the PERDRAW.DLL
in-process server and is made publicly available as a custom COM
component. Like all other servers in this tutorial series, PERDRAW.DLL is
a self-registering COM server. It makes the CODrawPage object type
available to clients as the DrawPage component in the PERDRAW server using
a CLSID_DrawPage registration in the Registry.

PERDRAW's makefile automatically registers its DrawPage COM component in
the registry, which it must do before clients can use PERDRAW.DLL as a
server for the DrawPage component. This self-registration is started in
the makefile using the REGISTER.EXE utility built in the REGISTER sample.
To build or run PERDRAW.DLL, you must build the REGISTER code sample
first.

For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.


Usage
-----

To use PERDRAW.DLL, a client program does not need to include PERDRAW.H or
link to PERDRAW.LIB. A COM client of PERDRAW.DLL obtains access solely
through its object's CLSID and COM services. For PERDRAW, that CLSID is
CLSID_DrawPage (defined in PAGEGUID.H in the common INC directory).
The PERCLIEN code sample shows how the client obtains this access.

PERDRAW.DLL is intended primarily as a COM server. Although it can be
implicitly loaded by linking to its associated .LIB file, it is normally
used after an explicit LoadLibrary call, usually from within COM's
CoGetClassObject function. PERDRAW is a self-registering in-process
server.

The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the PERDRAW directory:

  nmake register

This assumes that you have a compilation environment set up. If not, you
can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the PERDRAW directory.

  ..\register\register.exe perdraw.dll

These registration commands require a prior build of both the REGISTER
sample and PERDRAW.DLL.

In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Microsoft Platform SDK and
Visual C++ include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which can be used in a
similar fashion to register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.
