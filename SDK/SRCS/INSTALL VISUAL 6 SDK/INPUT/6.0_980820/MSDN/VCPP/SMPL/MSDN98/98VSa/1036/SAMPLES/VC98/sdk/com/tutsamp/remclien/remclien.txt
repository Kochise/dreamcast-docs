REMCLIEN -- Distributed COM (DCOM) Remote Client


SUMMARY
=======

The REMCLIEN sample shows how a client can access and control components
in an out-of-process remote server. In this lesson the previously studied
out-of-process server APTSERVE is used, but now it is accessed across
machine boundaries by REMCLIEN. In earlier lessons, APTCLIEN accessed
APTSERVE's components on the same machine by crossing only process and
thread boundaries.

No changes to APTSERVE are required for REMCLIEN to work. Distributed COM
(DCOM) supports local/remote transparency between client and server.

The REMCLIEN sample presents the car-related components that were studied
in previous lessons. These COM objects use the following interfaces: ICar,
IUtility, and ICruise. REMCLIEN works in conjunction with the separate
APTSERVE.EXE, which provides the COCar, COUtilityCar, and COCruiseCar
COM objects.

REMCLIEN.EXE creates its own COUtilityCruiseCar COM object by reusing the
COCruiseCar COM object by containment and augmenting it with a native
implementation of the IUtility interface. Because the COCruiseCar COM
object class is a composite--that is, it reuses an inner COCar object by
containment--REMCLIEN illustrates nested reuse of COM objects. The
composite COUtilityCruiseCar object reuses COCruiseCar, another composite
COM object, by containment. COCruiseCar further reuses the COCar COM
object by containment.

The composition of COUtilityCruiseCar is also interesting because
the COUtilityCruiseCar object's containment of the COCruiseCar object
crosses the machine boundary between REMCLIEN and the out-of-process
remote server APTSERVE.EXE. REMCLIEN uses standard marshaling
support for the custom interfaces it uses on the COCruiseCar object. This
marshaling support was separately built as MARSHAL.DLL in the earlier
MARSHAL code sample.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of REMCLIEN, see the
Code Tour section in REMCLIEN.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of REMCLIEN, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
REMCLIEN.HTM. To read REMCLIEN.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the REMCLIEN lesson in the table of lessons. You can
also achieve the same thing by clicking the REMCLIEN.HTM file after
locating the main tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also
APTSERVE.HTM in the main tutorial directory for more details on how
APTSERVE works and exposes its services to REMCLIEN. The makefile for
APTSERVE automatically registers that server in the registry of the host
machine, so you must build APTSERVE on the remote machine before
attempting to run REMCLIEN.

Because client and server reside in separate processes on different
machines, both REMCLIEN and APTSERVE rely on marshaling for the ICar,
IUtility, and ICruise interfaces. This support was provided by the
previous MARSHAL code sample, so you must also build the MARSHAL code
sample on both machines prior to building and running REMCLIEN with
APTSERVE.

To set up for the proper operation of REMCLIEN on one machine to control
APTSERVE on the other, both machines must be running Windows NT
Workstation 4.0 or above. Earlier versions do not support Distributed COM
(DCOM). The two machine must be connected in a properly configured
network. For details on setting up a network, see your Windows NT product
documentation or the Windows NT Resource Kit. Also see the "Network and
Setup Issues" section at the end of this tutorial text for more details on
machine and network setup for running REMCLIEN.

For general details on setting up your system to build and test Win32 code
samples such as those in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The
supplied MAKEFILE is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build,
issue the NMAKE command in the Command Prompt window.

Usage
-----

REMCLIEN is an application that you can execute directly from Windows in
the normal manner or from the Command Prompt window. No command line
parameters are recognized by REMCLIEN. REMCLIEN will not currently run on
the Windows 95 operating system until the necessary Distributed COM is
supported there.
