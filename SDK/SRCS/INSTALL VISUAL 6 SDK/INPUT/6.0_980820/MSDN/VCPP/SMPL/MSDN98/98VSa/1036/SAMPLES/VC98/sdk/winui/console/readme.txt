Demonstration of the Console Functions


The CONSOLE sample demonstrates most of the Win32 console functions. The 
program takes no parameters. After starting the sample, you can click one 
of the functions on the screen to get a demonstration of that function. 
When viewing a demo of the function, the title of the Console window is 
changed to show the name of the source file where that demo function 
resides. This should make it easy to find the sample code where the 
function of interest resides.

Please note that some of the demos cover multiple console functions, so 
some of the choices run the same demo.
