<h2><a name="FRECLIEN">FRECLIEN - Client of Free-threaded Server</a></h2>

<P>
NOTE: FRECLIEN uses CoInitializeEx. CoInitializeEx is implemented only on
Windows NT 4.0 and later versions. It is also implemented in the DCOM95
addition to Win95. This sample will not run on earlier versions of Windows
NT or on Win95 without DCOM95.

<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
The FRECLIEN sample spawns multiple threads to create and use the COBall
COM object provided by the FRESERVE free-threaded server. COBall object
itself spawns no threads; it passively responds to IBall interface
requests from multiple client threads. The FRECLIEN client creates and
controls one COBall object through the IBall interface that the object
exposes. As three of FRECLIEN's threads move the ball through calls to
IBall::Move, the remaining main thread uses a system timer to obtain timed
updates of the COBall object's position, size, and color. This main thread
uses that data, obtained by calling the IBall::GetBall method, to display
graphical snapshot images of the ball in the client's main window.

<P>
As explained in the FRESERVE sample, the COBall object internally updates
its color property to reflect the last thread that called the object's
Move method. The display thread uses this data for each ball image it
displays. As the ball moves, it changes color to reflect the changing
threads that move the ball. As the ball moves, it also leaves a trail that
provides a striking visual history of these passing threads. This trail
demonstrates that, with COM's free threading model, all threads that make
interface requests to the same object access the object on the different
calling threads. Each different color of the single ball object represents
a different calling thread. Since the display thread is asynchronous with
respect to the ball-moving threads, there is no guarantee that the display
trail will include a record of every thread that moved the ball. Based on
thread scheduling and on the load of other applications running, not all
threads that move the ball are caught in the act by the display thread.

<P>
This free threading model is in contrast to the apartment model presented
in the APTSERVE and APTCLIEN samples. In apartment model threading, each
COM object is associated with an single-threaded apartment. Calls from
multiple client threads are switched by COM to the thread of the apartment
that owns the object. Only one thread, the object's apartment thread, is
permitted to execute the methods of the object. This provides a
serialization of access to the object's data.

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of FRECLIEN, see the
Code Tour section in FRECLIEN.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of FRECLIEN, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
FRECLIEN.HTM. To read FRECLIEN.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the FRECLIEN lesson in the table of lessons. You can
also achieve the same thing by clicking the FRECLIEN.HTM file after
locating the main tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also
FRESERVE.HTM in the main tutorial directory for more details on how
FRESERVE works and exposes its services to FRECLIEN. You must build the
FRESERVE DLL before building FRECLIEN. The makefile for FRESERVE
automatically registers that server in the system registry, so you must
build FRESERVE before attempting to run FRECLIEN.

<P>
For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE
is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

<P>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<P>
FRECLIEN is an application that you can execute directly from Windows in
the normal manner or from the Command Prompt window. No command line
parameters are recognized by FRECLIEN. FRECLIEN currently requires the
free-threading facilities provided in more recent releases of COM such as
found in version 4.0 and later releases of the Windows NT operating
system. The Windows 95 operating system does not currently support free
threading, so FRECLIEN will not run on it. However, a DCOM95 add-on to
Win95 will permit the FRECLIEN/FRESERVE samples to run on Win95. DCOM95 is
currently nearing release.

<h4>Run the Sample</h4>

<p>
The client sample and other related samples must be compiled before
you can run the client. For more details on building the samples, see
<a href="using.htm#building">
Building the Code Samples.</a>

<P>
If you have already built the appropriate samples, FRECLIEN.EXE is the
client executable to run for this sample.

<a href="FRECLIEN\FRECLIEN.exe">
Click here to run FRECLIEN.EXE.</a>

<P>
Depending on the security level of your browser you may see a dialog
allowing you to either open the .EXE file or save it to disk. Click the
"Open it" choice and then click the OK button.

<p>&#160;
<h3>OPERATION</h3>

<P>
The FRECLIEN.EXE application provides the user interface for this lesson.
It exercises the associated, but independent, FRESERVE.DLL to graphically
illustrate the free threading model. As the ball image created by FRECLIEN
moves, it leaves a trail. This trail shows a history of the various
threads that have executed the COBall object's Move method.

<P>
Here is a summary of operation from the standpoint of FRECLIEN.EXE as a
COM client of the FRESERVE.DLL COM server.

<P>
There is a minimal menu in FRECLIEN. All the operation is automatic. The
main application window's client area is used for visual display of the
moving ball.

<p>Menu Selection: File/Exit<br>
Exits FRECLIEN.

<P>Menu Selection: Help/FRECLIEN Tutorial<br>
Opens the FRECLIEN.HTM tutorial file in the Web browser.

<P>Menu Selection: Help/FRESERVE Tutorial<br>
Opens the FRESERVE.HTM tutorial file in the Web browser.

<p>Menu Selection: Help/Read Source File<br>
Displays the Open common dialog box so you can open a source file from
this lesson or another one in the Windows Notepad.

<p>Menu Selection: Help/About FRECLIEN<br>
Displays the About dialog box for this application, a standard part of
this series of code samples. The code illustrates how to program the use
of the CAboutBox class provided by APPUTIL.LIB.

<P>
FRECLIEN uses many of the utility classes and services provided by
APPUTIL. For more details on APPUTIL, study the APPUTIL library source
code in the sibling APPUTIL directory and APPUTIL.HTM in the main tutorial
directory.

<P>
The program logic governing the ball's motion is encapsulated in the
COBall object. See the FRESERVE sample and FRESERVE.HTM for details.

<P>
The major topics covered in this code tour are:

<ul>
<li>initializing COM for free-threaded access to the FRESERVE server and
its components

<li>the construction of the CGuiBall C++ object

<li>multithreading in FRECLIEN

<li>the use of the system timer; and shutdown of the client

</ul>

<p>The main FRECLIEN process initializes COM for free-threaded operation.
It does this in the WinMain function. Here is the code from FRECLIEN.CPP.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  ...
  // Call to initialize the COM Library.  Use the SUCCEEDED macro
  // to detect success.  If fail, then exit app with error message.
  // Initialize COM here in the main process thread to establish this
  // main thread as the founding member of the multi-threaded apartment
  // of this process. Other worker free-threads will also live in this
  // multi-threaded apartment. The app can have only one such multi-
  // threaded apartment but could have a mixed model with other
  // single-threaded apartments running. This sample has no other
  // single-threaded apartments.
  if (SUCCEEDED(CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_MULTITHREADED)))
  {
    ...
    ... Init application and enter main message loop, etc
    ...
  }
    ...
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The CoInitializeEx function is called with the COINIT_MULTITHREADED flag.
This means that COM is initialized to use the free-threading model in
FRECLIEN's main message loop thread. Other worker threads will be created
and initialized as COINIT_MULTITHREADED. These worker threads will also
operate in the free-threaded model on a single instance of FRESERVE's
COBall COM object.

<P>
FRECLIEN uses a CGuiBall C++ class to encapsulate the data and behavior
of the client's graphical user interface (GUI) moving ball.

<P>
Here is the declaration of the CGuiBall class from file GUIBALL.H.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  class CGuiBall
  {
    private:
      HWND     m_hWnd;
      IBall*   m_pIBall;
      COLORREF m_crColor;

      // Pointers to thread init data structures.
      CThreadInitData m_BallThreadData1;
      CThreadInitData m_BallThreadData2;
      CThreadInitData m_BallThreadData3;

    public:
      // Some member variables to store thread ids.
      DWORD m_dwBallThread1;
      DWORD m_dwBallThread2;
      DWORD m_dwBallThread3;

      // An array of handles to the ball threads.
      HANDLE m_hBallThreads[3];

      CGuiBall(void);
      ~CGuiBall(void);
      BOOL Init(HWND hWnd);
      void PaintBall(void);
      void Restart(void);
      void PaintWin(void);
  };
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The main process thread uses CGuiBall by calling its main public methods:
Init, Restart, PaintBall, and PaintWin. Calls through the IBall interface
on FRESERVE's COBall object are encapsulated within the methods of
CGuiBall. The COBall object is accessed through an IBall interface
pointer, m_pIBall, privately held in CGuiBall.

<P>
CGuiBall has an Init method in which an instance of FRESERVE's COBall
object is created. This Init method also spawns three threads whose sole
job is to continuously call COBall::Move to move the ball entity defined
in COBall. These three calling threads keep the ball moving while the main
display thread continuously paints snapshot images of the moving ball.
CGuiBall keeps the identifiers of these three threads. Several
CThreadInitData structures are used to create the threads.

<P>
Here is the CGuiBall::Init method definition from GUIBALL.CPP.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  BOOL CGuiBall::Init(
         HWND hWnd)

 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
CoCreateInstance is called to create an instance of the FRESERVE server's
COBall object specified by its CLSID, CLSID_DllBall. This CLSID is defined
in BALLGUID.H, located in the sibling INC directory. Because aggregation
is not required, CoCreateInstance directly requests the IBall interface,
which on return is stored in m_pIBall. The Init method then launches the
three moving threads after setting appropriate CThreadInitData structures.
This is the CThreadInitData as declared in GUIBALL.H.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  // A small utility struct providing an encapsulation of data needed when
  // worker threads are initialized.
  struct CThreadInitData
  {
    HWND   m_hWnd;
    IBall* m_pIBall;
    DWORD  m_nDelay;
  };
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
As presented in the previous APTSERVE sample, a pointer to a
CThreadInitData structure is passed as an LPARAM to the thread procedure
of the newly launched thread. Using this structure, the client's main
window handle, an interface pointer to the IBall interface on the COBall
object, and a value for the time delay between ball movements are all
passed to the new threads. Following the COM contract, the Init method
calls m_pIBall-&gt;AddRef for each copy of the interface pointer returned to
the newly created thread. These AddRef calls are later matched by Release
calls in the CGuiBall destructor.

<P>
Note that the interface pointer in member m_pIBall is passed from one
thread, the main thread, to the newly created thread. This requires no
marshaling because both threads are in the same multi-threaded apartment
of the process. If the creating thread was in a single-threaded apartment
that was creating a new thread in the multi-threaded apartment then
explicit marshaling of the passed m_pIBall interface would be required.
The CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream and
CoGetInterfaceAndReleaseStream functions are convenient for such explicit
runtime marshaling of interfaces between threads within a process.

<P>
The m_hBallThreads array holds handles to the created threads. It is used
for later calls to WaitForMultipleObjects to ensure an orderly shutdown of
the threads before the client program exits. This occurs in the CGuiBall
destructor.  Here is the destructor from GUIBALL.CPP.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  CGuiBall::~CGuiBall(void)
  {
    BOOL bOk = TRUE;

    if (m_pIBall)
    {
      // Kill the client's app timer for its repaints.
      KillTimer(m_hWnd, 1);

      // Call down to the server's COBall and tell it to shutdown.
      m_pIBall-&gt;Move(FALSE);

      // Wait for the threads to terminate before closing their
      // thread handles.
      WaitForMultipleObjects(3, m_hBallThreads, TRUE, INFINITE);
      for (size_t i = 0; i&lt;3; i++)
        CloseHandle(m_hBallThreads[i]);

      // Release for each of the thread copies handed out.
      m_pIBall->Release();
      m_pIBall->Release();
      m_pIBall->Release();
      // Do final Release for the main copy held in CGuiBall.
      RELEASE_INTERFACE(m_pIBall);
    }
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The main process thread relies on a recurrent system timer's WM_TIMER
message. This was set up within the Init method of CGuiBall shown above.
These periodic timer messages drive the client's independent asynchronous
display process. The timer is killed in the destructor (see above) with
the KillTimer call. Each WM_TIMER message sent to the main window
procedure is honored by a call to the COBall::GetBall method to obtain the
ball's display data. Here is the main window procedure from FRECLIEN.CPP.

WM_TIMER messages arrive. Other main client application messages of
interest are WM_SIZE, WM_PAINT, and WM_LBUTTONUP. For WM_SIZE, if the user
resizes the client application's main window, CGuiBall::Restart is called.
The WM_SIZE message handler calls COBall::Reset, which relocates the ball
to the upper left corner of the window and also resets the ball size. If
the user clicks the left mouse button (causing WM_LBUTTONUP) or a general
WM_PAINT condition occurs, the window is repainted, but the ball is not
reset.

<P>
The threads each run the following common thread procedure, BallThreadProc
in GUIBALL.CPP.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  DWORD WINAPI BallThreadProc(
                 LPARAM lparam)
  {
    CThreadInitData* pInitData = (CThreadInitData*) lparam;
    DWORD nEndCount = 0;
    HRESULT hr;
    BOOL bAlive;

    // Initialize COM for use by this thread. Tell COM this new thread
    // is another free-threaded thread in the multi-threaded apartment.
    hr = CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_MULTITHREADED);
    bAlive = SUCCEEDED(hr);

    if (bAlive)
    {
      // Continuously move the ball while it is still alive.
      while (bAlive)
      {
        // Use system timer to slow down the ball motion to the range
        // of the humanly perceptible.
        if (GetTickCount() &gt; nEndCount)
        {
          // After the delay, call from this thread thru IBall interface
          // to move the ball that lives in the single COBall COM object.
          // Set bAlive flag FALSE if the COBall can no longer move.
          hr = pInitData-&gt;m_pIBall-&gt;Move(TRUE);
          bAlive = (NOERROR == hr);

          // Set new timer end count.
          nEndCount = GetTickCount() + pInitData-&gt;m_nDelay;
        }
      }

      // UnInitialize COM for use by this thread.
      CoUninitialize();
    }

    return 0;
  }

<P>
Within each launched worker thread, COM is initialized specifying
COINIT_MULTITHREADED to indicate the new thread will execute as part of
the process's multi-threaded apartment. Each of the three threads executes
this same re-entrant thread procedure. Within the procedure, each thread
executes an indefinite while loop containing a call to the IBall::Move
method on the COBall object. Because these move calls would be far too
fast for human perception, each thread is kept busy in a delay countdown
using the system timer tick count. This sample uses delays in the
neighborhood of 100 milliseconds. When the delay is over, the Move method
is called on the COBall object. The three threads are running concurrently
and could make the Move calls at conflicting times. As explained in the
FRESERVE sample, the Move method on COBall is guarded by the CThreaded
OwnThis mechanism. If one of the threads currently owns the COBall object,
a Move call by another thread will block the calling thread until it can
obtain ownership.

<P>
Each thread's while loop terminates in BallThreadProc when the Move call
that is made there returns E_FAIL. This return signals that some other
thread had killed the ball by calling the Move method with the bAlive
parameter set to FALSE. This terminating call is actually made by the main
application thread and not by any of the ball-moving threads. The call is
made in the CGuiBall destructor shown above. The destructor is run when
the main CGuiBall object is deleted because the user has closed or exited
the main application, causing an exit of the main process thread's message
loop in WinMain.
