<P>
This document outlines how to integrate Microsoft's user authentication
protocol into standard HTTP authentication messages. This is useful
for supporting secure browsing on Intranets based on Windows NT
Domain Security and of the Microsoft Network Internet online service
which is adopting this protocol in its Web services for MSN membership.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H2>1.0 WWW-Authenticate</H2></FONT>

If authentication is required for a requested resource, then the
HTTP server returns a 401 (unauthorized) response message. Section
10.17 of the HTTP/1.0 RFC defines the <TT>WWW-Authenticate</TT>
response header which must be included in the 401 response message.
Furthermore, the specification provides that multiple WWW-Authenticate
response headers may be returned. This indicates that multiple
authentication means are available and the client may choose one
of them.
<P>
The HTTP/1.0 specification defines two kinds of authentication:
(1) an &quot;Access Authentication&quot; scheme which allows for
a very simple challenge-response; and (2) the &quot;BASIC&quot;
authentication scheme where the username/password is sent over
in cleartext to the server. Obviously, the latter provides weak
security unless the channel is first link encrypted with SSL or
PCT. Even with link encryption, Basic Authentication is inappropriate
where it is unacceptable for servers to directly see users passwords
such as corporate Intranets and Internet online services comprised
of third-party sites.
<P>
Although only inferred, HTTP/1.0 does permit other authentication
schemes by way of &quot;WWW-Authenticate&quot;. This extensibility
allows for the more complex MSN and NT challenge-response authentication
mechanisms to be implemented.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H3>1.1 WWW-Authenticate and NT Authentication</H3></FONT>

The NT challenge-response sequence is a bit more complicated than
that provided by the simple challenge-response scheme in the HTTP/1.0
specification. This is due, in part, to the fact that the challenge
is based on the username, thus requiring more than just a single
challenge-response sequence.
<P>
If authentication is required for a requested resource and NT
Authentication is enabled, the server will respond with a response
header as follows:
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#202080><PRE>
	WWW-Authenticate = "WWW-Authenticate" ":" "NTLM" SP ntlm-chaldata CRLF

	ntlm-chaldata   = &lt;base64  encoding of challenge data&gt;
</PRE></FONT>
<P>

The tag &quot;NTLM&quot; signifies NT Authentication package.
The <TT>ntlm-chaldata</TT> is not returned in the initial response
header. The protocol details are described later in this document
in the section <I>NTLM Authentication Scheme</I>.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H3>1.2 WWW-Authenticate and MSN Authentication</H3></FONT>

<P>
In an MSN authentication environment, a <TT>WWW-Authenticate</TT>
response header may indicate that MSN authentication is available.
It will be formatted as follows:
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#202080><PRE>
	WWW-Authenticate = "WWW-Authenticate" ":" "MSN" SP msn-chaldata CRLF 

	msn-chaldata     = &lt;base64 encoding of challenge data&gt;
</PRE></FONT>
<P>

The MSN authentication sequence is virtually identical to the
NTLM authentication sequence and is described later in this document.
The <TT>msn-chaldata</TT> is not returned in the initial response
header.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H3>1.3 Privacy and Challenge-Response Authentication</H3></FONT>

<P>
Although challenge-response authentication affords some measure
of security against impersonation and password compromise, many
schemes are not necessarily foolproof. The idea behind a challenge-response
protocol is that the password in never actually sent over the
network. User authentication in Windows NT and MSN uses the NTLM
challenge-response protocol.
<P>
As computers become increasingly faster and cheaper, brute force
attacks on challenge &amp; response data will become easier. However,
if the challenge/response data itself is encrypted, it helps to
prevent snooping and insure better security. Microsoft recommends
using SSL or PCT during the challenge/response sequence.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H2>2.0 NT Authentication Components</H2></FONT>

<P>
In order to understand how to layer NT Authentication on HTTP,
it is helpful to understand the run-time components that are involved
in the process. The components (typically DLLs) and calling model
may vary slightly depending on the platform and authentication
server used.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H3>2.1 Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) Specification</H3></FONT>

<P>
SSPI is an API defined by Microsoft and provided for all versions
of Windows since Windows NT 3.5. Designed to isolate Windows NT
and custom applications from the underlying security implementation
so new security packages such as Kerberos could be easily added
in the future. Application developers can use this feature by
calling SSPI directly or writing to Microsoft RPC which handles
these calls as part of RPC's authentication support.
<P>

See the help file <A HREF="issp.hlp">issp.hlp</A> for information on the APIs.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H3>2.2 NT-LAN Manager (NTLM) Security Support Provider (SSP) Specification</H3></FONT>

<P>
Currently the only security package that ships with Windows Operating
Systems is NTLM (NT-LAN Manager), a shared secret user challenge-response
authentication protocol that supports pass-through authentication
to a domain controller in the servers domain or in a domain trusted
by the current domain's domain controller. This is implemented
in SECUR32.DLL on Windows 95 and SECURITY.DLL on Windows NT. The
NTLM SSP exposes an SSPI interface, callable by the operating
system and applications.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H3>2.3 MSN Security Support Provider (SSP) Specification</H3></FONT>

<P>
To support pass-through authentication from distributed servers
owned by MSN and partners, MSN uses the NTLM protocol. The messages
are the same except instead of passing requests to a domain controller
which checks NT's Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database, servers
pass requests to agents in the MSN data center which check MSN's
accounts database and mapped returned MSN security rights to Windows
NT Groups so native NT ACLs can be used for enforcing privileges.
The client SSP shipped in January, 1996 with MSN 1.2 and the server
components will be deployed by MSN and key partners during 1996.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H2>3.0 Browser Support</H2></FONT>

<P>
Given the wide variety of Web Browsers available and the growing
use of Window NT Domain Security on Intranets and MSN on the Internet,
it is important to corporations to have NT Authentication supported

<P>
To support new HTTP authentication packages, Spyglass defined
the SPM API which has been adopted by the Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Other Web browsers can support SPM API or call SSPI directly.
Microsoft has shipped an SPM module as the layer between the SPM
API and SSPI to support the NTLM and MSN authentication protocols.
In addition this SPM module will take care of all future SSPI
pkgs. as well. Additional SPM modules don't need to be written
for every SSPI package in the future.
<P>
SPM is implemented in the file SEC_SSPI.DLL that first shipped
with MSN 1.2 for use with Internet Explorer 2.0 on Windows 95
and is freely available.
<P>
Microsoft will be including SSPI and therefore NT and MSN authentication
support in the HTTP protocol implementation being provided in
the WinInet APIs that are planned for the future. Future versions
of Internet Explorer will use this API. Client software vendors
are encouraged to use WinInet as well to leverage the authenticated
HTTP implementation. However, one can continue to develop their
own HTTP protocol using the guidelines in this document and sample
code for interfacing to SSPI.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H3>3.1 HTTP Keep Alives</H3></FONT>

<P>
&quot;Keep Alives&quot; are a useful feature initiated by browsers
to maintain the HTTP and TCP sessions to eliminate frequent session
creation overhead such as re-authentication.
<P>
to the same server. Keep Alives are actually critical to support
NTLM in HTTP so that the complete set of challenge-response message
can be exchanged before the session is terminated. Keep-alive
is requted with the <TT>Connection: Keep-Alive</TT> attribute
in the HTTP message.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H3>3.2 Multiple Browser Support</H3></FONT>

<P>
It is desirable to enable NT Authentication from a variety of
web browsers. Many corporations already have internal NT networks
set up, along with administrative procedures therein. By enabling
NT authentication, departments can properly control access to
sensitive data shared through web pages. In the public network
environment, corporate employees (or selected customers) may be
granted access to certain web pages which may not be available
to the general public. In this latter case, it is especially desirable
to avoid using the HTTP Basic authentication scheme. MSN will
be using this protocol and encourages browser vendors to support
it to provide users with choice.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H2>4.0 NTLM Authentication Scheme</H2></FONT>

<P>
The following diagram illustrates the basic NT Authentication
protocol used by both Windows NT and MSN:
<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="auth1.gif" ALT="(picture auth1.gif)">
</CENTER>
<P>

Typically, the virtual circuit is closed after a 401 (unauthorized)
response message. When negotiating an NT authentication sequence
(which requires multiple round trips), the server keeps the virtual
circuit open after the client has indicated that it wishes to
use NTLM authentication. The circuit is kept open for the duration
of the challenge-response sequence, and may be kept alive longer.
<P>
Note that <TT>Connection: Keep-Alive</TT> must be included in
the initial as well as the subsequent HTTP operations. Without
this, the server may not offer to negotiate NTLM authentication.
Whenever a virtual circuit is closed, authentication is lost.
At this time, every individual virtual circuit must negotiate
the authentication sequence.
<P>
Note that HTTP imposes a character count limit on the challenge
and challenge-response data. Furthermore, the data is always uuencoded.
This also necessitates several round trips (and is something that
should be addressed in a future version of HTTP).
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H3>4.1 Sample Code</H3></FONT>

<P>
In order to better illustrate the protocol sequence, sample source
code is included. The sample code will be an NT Command Line application
which illustrates a simple HTTP &quot;GET&quot; operation. If
NTLM authentication is indicated in the 401 response message from
the server, then the sequence is negotiated. Otherwise, the application
fails, indicating that NTLM authentication was not available.
&quot;Basic&quot; authentication is not negotiated by the sample
application.
<P>
The sample code is in Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 and includes the
appropriate make and header files. The code buils into a very
simple program which allows the user to see the negotiated HTTP
headers. The command line syntax is:
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#202080><PRE>
	httpauth  [-h] [-d:&lt;size&gt;] [-m:&lt;methodlist&gt;] [-v:&lt;verb&gt;] [-n:&lt;username&gt;]
	          [-p:&lt;password&gt;] [-g:gateway] [-s:storefile] &lt;server&gt; &lt;path&gt;
		-h           - display result headers
		&lt;size&gt;       - amount of client data to send
		&lt;verb&gt;       - HTTP verb to use (default is GET)
		&lt;username&gt;   - user name for authentication
		&lt;password&gt;   - password for authentication
		&lt;methodlist&gt; - comma separated list of authentication methods in order
		               of preference (Default is to use first supported method
		               returned by the HTTP server (e.g., -m:NTLM,BASIC)
		&lt;storefile&gt;  - file where to store result message body
		&lt;server&gt;     - web server to connect to (without http:)
		&lt;path&gt;       - resource to get (e.g., /default.htm)
</PRE></FONT>
<P>

For example, the following command line retrieves the headers for
http://www.server.com/doc/info.html:
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#202080><PRE>
	httpget -h -m:NTLM,BASIC -v:GET -n:GUEST -p:GUEST www.server.com /doc/info.html
</PRE></FONT>

<P>
This command will produce the following approximate header output
(assuming that the server does not allow anonymous login):
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#202080><PRE>
	HTTP/1.0 401 Access Denied
	WWW-Authenticate: Basic
	WWW-Authenticate: NTLM
	Content-Length: 24

	HTTP/1.0 401 Access Denied
	WWW-Authenticate: NTLM TlRMTVNTUAACAAAAAAAAACgAAAABggAA0BYwmlRObo4AAAAAAAAAAA==
	Connection: keep-alive
	Content-Length: 24

	HTTP/1.0 200 OK
	Date: Tue, 27 Feb 1996 19:31:49 GMT
	Server: Microsoft-Internet-Information-Server/1.0
	Connection: keep-alive

<P>

The source code is provided for reference to illustrate how a
web browser would negotiate NT Authentication. An executable version
for Intel platforms is included.
<P>
The include files sspi.h and issperr.h are from the Win-32 SDK,
but are included for your convenience. The sample is provided
&quot;as-is&quot;.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=#000080><H2>5.0 Notes</H2></FONT>

<OL>
<LI>When &quot;BASIC&quot; Authentication is negotiated with the
Microsoft Internet Informatuion Server, the authenticated user
is treated as if he or she logged on <I>locally </I>(meaning that
as far as NT Security is concerned, the web user has the appearance
of being logged in locally rather than being logged in as a &quot;network&quot;
User).
<LI>If an invalid username is supplied in the NT Authentication sequence, the server will
try to use the account &quot;Guest&quot; with no password to gain access to the resource. This
occurs only with &quot;NTLM&quot; authentication and not &quot;Basic&quot; authentication. System
administrators can do the following: 
(a) disable the Guest account; (b) give the Guest account a non-null password;
or (c) set ACLs on the \wwwroot directory and file resources.
