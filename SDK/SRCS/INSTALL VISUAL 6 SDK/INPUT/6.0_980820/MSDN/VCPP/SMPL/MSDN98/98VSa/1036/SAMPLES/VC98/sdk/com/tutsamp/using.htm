<P>
To build any of the COM Tutorial Samples, your computer environment must
be set up to build Win32 C++ applications with a properly installed 32-bit
C++ compiler, linker, and resource compiler that are compatible with
Microsoft Visual C++&reg; 4.x or above, and a properly installed Platform
SDK. It is usually wise to install the Win32 Platform SDK last. The
Platform SDK provides .H include and .LIB library files needed for the COM
functionality coded in the samples.

<P>
Because this sample series originated as an integral part of the Platform
SDK, the tutorial narrative assumes an environment with the Platform SDK
properly installed. However, releases of Microsoft Visual C++ after
version 4.0 may also provide the .H include and .LIB library files needed
for compilation. In such cases, installation of the Win32 Platform SDK may
not be required to compile the samples.

<P>
To successfully run the REMCLIEN, FRESERVE, and FRECLIEN samples requires
system facilities that are only available in more recent versions of the
32-bit Windows operating systems. REMCLIEN, FRESERVE, and FRECLIEN require
the Windows NT version 4.0 or later. The REMCLIEN, FRESERVE, and FRECLIEN
samples will build but will not run on the Windows 95 operating system
until Distributed COM (DCOM) and free threaded COM are supported in that
operating system. This support is available for the Windows 95 operating
system in the DCOM95 add on.  DCOM95 can currently be obtained by download
from Microsoft's world wide Web site at:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/com/" target="_blank">
http://www.microsoft.com/com/</a>.

<P>
Each sample directory has the necessary source files to build and run the
sample. The parent sample directory has a MAKEALL.BAT file, which you can
run to make all the code samples in the branch below. See the MAKEALL.BAT
file for details on usage. If your environment is set up to build Win32
C++ applications, you can simply run MAKEALL.BAT from the directory where
it resides to build all the code samples in the branch below. MAKEALL
ensures the correct order to the build so that all the code sample
dependencies are satisfied.

<P>
The main directory also has a makefile that builds all the tutorial code
samples using options similar to those supported by MAKEALL.BAT. See this
makefile for details on options. This makefile assumes that the entire
code samples branch is installed as part of the Win32 Platform SDK.
Currently this location has a path similar to
D:\MSSDK\SAMPLES\COM\TUTSAMP, where D: represents the installation drive.
If you have extracted the tutorial code sample branch (eg, directory COM
and below) to another location outside the Platform SDK (or if you
obtained the sample set as a separate download from the Microsoft World
Wide Web site), then use MAKEALL.BAT to compile all the samples in the
branch. In general, MAKEALL.BAT is the recommended way to go. A
LOGMALL.BAT file is also provided. It does the same as MAKEALL.BAT except
that it logs all compilation output to file ERRORLOG.TXT in the main
tutorial directory.

<P>
Two batch files, REGALL.BAT and UNREGALL.BAT, are also provided in the
main directory to register and unregister all COM servers in the tutorial
code sample series. To register all servers, run REGALL.BAT file from the
main directory. To unregister all servers, run UNREGALL.BAT in the same
manner. These batch files require a prior build of the REGISTER, MARSHAL,
DLLSERVE, LICSERVE, LOCSERVE, APTSERVE, FRESERVE, and CONSERVE code
samples. If you perform a normal build of the code samples, the server
makefiles will automatically register the servers. In this case you do not
need to run the REGALL.BAT batch file.

<P>
Run the CLEANALL.BAT batch file to perform an exhaustive CLEANALL of all
the COM Tutorial Samples. WARNING: This batch file deletes all Visual
Studio&reg: project files and other temporary work files created by
VC++&reg; in the samples. All of the COM servers that are built in the
tutorial code samples are unregistered from the registry. All executable
EXE and DLL files are deleted. All debug symbol files are deleted. Files
that are generated in a variety of build environments are also deleted.

<P>
Run 'MAKEALL CLEAN' to perform a faster but more modest cleanup of all the
code samples. This cleaning operation does not attempt to be as
comprehensive as that performed by CLEANALL.BAT. The .OBJ files are
deleted but the output binaries are retained. The COM servers are not
unregistered from the registry.

<P>
The installed Win32 Platform SDK provides a SETENV.BAT file located in the
\MSSDK directory that you can run to set up your environment for building
applications that use the Platform SDK.

<P>
You can also manually set up your environment by adding something like the
following to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Under Windows 95, you can edit the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file to include these commands. Under Windows NT, you can
edit or add these settings to your environment variables using the System
dialog that you can run from the Control Panel.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  SET INCLUDE=D:\MSSDK\INCLUDE;C:\MSDEV\INCLUDE;C:\MSDEV\MFC\INCLUDE
  SET LIB=D:\MSSDK\LIB;C:\MSDEV\LIB;C:\MSDEV\MFC\LIB
  SET MSSDK=D:\MSSDK
  SET MSTOOLS=D:\MSSDK
  SET CPU=i386
  SET PATH=C:\WIN95;C:\WIN95\COMMAND;C:\DOS;D:\MSSDK\BIN;C:\MSDEV\BIN
</FONT> </PRE>

<p>
These settings are appropriate for an Intel 80386 or better platform
running Windows 95 with both Microsoft Visual C++ and the Platform
SDK installed. On this system, Visual C++ version 4.2 is installed under
the C:\MSDEV directory. The Platform SDK is installed under the D:\MSSDK
directory. Your disk configuration may be different. The Platform SDK
directories (i.e., those with D:\MSSDK in them above) are all earlier in
each path sequence. This sequence assumes that command line compilations
are intended to be run in the Command Prompt window and that the .H
include and .LIB library files in the Win32 Platform SDK are preferred for
those compilations.

<p>
The D:\MSDEV\MFC\INCLUDE and D:MSDEV\MFC\LIB directories are shown in the
INCLUDE and LIB paths, but they are not required to build the tutorial
code samples. In this particular setup, Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC)
applications are being compiled, as well as straight COM and Win32
applications.

<p>
The CPU environment variable is defined to control the Win32 builds,
depending on the platform. Current possible values are i386, MIPS, ALPHA,
and PPC. For more details, see the WIN32.MAK file provided in the Win32
Platform SDK in the \MSSDK\INCLUDE directory. All of the COM tutorial
code sample makefiles include WIN32.MAK.

<p>
The makefiles for each of the code samples in this series are generic
Win32 makefiles and are meant to be built from the Command Prompt window.
They assume Microsoft compiler and linker tools and will probably need
some modification to work with other tools. Most compiler/linker command
line switches are specified by macros that are defined in the WIN32.MAK
makefile include file (supplied as part of the Platform SDK). The
MAKEALL.BAT file and each respective code sample makefile support the
following common options for invocation from the Command Prompt window to
control the nature of the build:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  NMAKE invocation   MAKEALL invocation    Effect
  -----------------  --------------------  ---------------------------------
  nmake              makeall               Compile with debug info.
  nmake nodebug=1    makeall &quot;nodebug=1&quot;   Compile without debug info.
  nmake profile=1    makeall &quot;profile=1&quot;   Compile with profiling info.
  nmake tune=1       makeall &quot;tune=1&quot;      With working set tuner info.
  nmake unicode=1    makeall &quot;unicode=1&quot;   Compile for UNICODE.
  nmake clean        makeall clean         Delete temporary binaries.
  nmake cleanall     makeall cleanall      Delete all generated files.
</FONT> </PRE>

<p>
For the MAKEALL.BAT invocations you need the quotes as shown. The nodebug,
profile, and tune options are mutually exclusive: you may use only one of
them (or none) for a given compilation/link. To compile the samples to run
with UNICODE strings, use the unicode=1 option. The default is to compile
for the traditional ANSI string support, because you can then easily run
on either Windows NT or Windows 95. Currently, you must compile without
UNICODE to run these code samples on Windows 95. You can freely compile
and run with or without UNICODE on Windows NT. Be careful that APPUTIL is
always compiled with the same options as the other code samples you may be
separately compiling. This is especially true for the unicode=1 option.

<P>
You may use an installed 32-bit C++ integrated development environment
(IDE) to build the samples using the generic makefiles provided. But to do
so requires that within your IDE you treat the generic makefiles as
'external' makefiles. The makefiles provided require a Microsoft
NMAKE-compatible make utility.

<p>
Most C++ IDEs can recognize these makefiles as external and yet still give
many of the edit-build-debug benefits of the IDE. For example, in
Microsoft's Developer Studio&reg; in the Visual C++ 5+ product, you can
simply use the File menu's Open Workspace choice to produce a project file
by opening an appropriately named copy of the code sample's Win32
makefile.

<p>
To open a sample's Win32 makefile and create a matching new project in
Visual C++ Developer Studio&reg; version 5+, follow these steps.

<ol>
<li>
Copy the sample's MAKEFILE to a file named &lt;sample&gt;.MAK in the sample
directory. For example, in the EXESKEL directory, copy MAKEFILE to a new
file named EXESKEL.MAK.

<li>
Choose Open Workspace in the File Menu.

<li>
In the Open Project Workspace dialog locate the desired sample directory
and enter &lt;sample&gt;.MAK for the file name and click the Open button
(where &lt;sample&gt; is the name of the sample).

<li>
Developer Studio then detects that the .MAK makefile was not generated by
Developer Studio and notifies you in a dialog. Click the Yes button to
continue.

<li>
Depending on your Win32 platform you may next see a dialog asking you to
select the target platforms for the new project. If so, check the Win32
platform and click Ok.

</ol>

<p>
From there you can use the editor, debugger, and project facilities to
edit, compile, link, and debug. Note that in versions of VC++ earlier than
5.0 the above steps may be a little different. For example, with version
4.x you can open the MAKEFILE file directly (via Open Project Workspace)
and a subsequent Save As dialog permits you to name the project file
&lt;sample&gt;.MAK.

<p>
Some of the visual IDEs can also easily generate one of their native
project makefiles, given the existing source files of a code sample. If
you are using such an IDE, generating such a native project makefile can
be very worthwhile because it offers a way to browse the C++ classes of
the program. See your IDE documentation for details on using external
makefiles or on creating a native project makefile using a set of existing
source files.

<p>
Aside from the dependence on the common code in the sibling APPUTIL, INC,
and LIB directories, many code samples are self-contained. You need to
build APPUTIL before you build any of the other code samples. Some samples
later in the sequence may work with the compiled results of earlier
samples. These code sample interdependencies are as follows.

<p>
Though the code samples are divided into a series of tutorial lessons, the
appropriate sample groupings can easily be extracted from the collection.
Most of the individual sample directories are meant to work in conjunction
with at least one other sample directory. The component-related samples
consist of a client and server pair, with the server requiring the use of
the REGISTER sample utility. Here is a summary of the sample groupings and
how to extract each group as a buildable unit. For each sample grouping,
copy the content of the directories shown. The parent [destination]
directory shown requires no content from the samples branch. However, the
help menus in the running samples do assume that the appropriate tutorial
.HTM help files are located in this parent [destination] directory.

<h3>Coding Style Conventions</h3>

<p>
Because this tutorial covers a graduated sequence of code samples, certain
coding style conventions are used to aid clarity and consistency. The
"Hungarian" notation conventions are used. These have become a common
coding practice in Win32 programming. They include variable prefix
notations that give to variable names a suggestion of the type of the
variable. The following prefixes are common:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  a       Array
  b       BOOL (int)
  by      Unsigned Char (byte)
  c       Char
  cb      Count of bytes
  cr      Color reference value
  cx      Count of x (short)
  dw      DWORD (unsigned long)
  f       Flags (usually multiple bit values)
  fn      Function
  g_      global
  h       Handle
  i       Integer
  l       Long
  lp      Long pointer
  m_      Data member of a class
  n       Short int
  p       Pointer
  s       String
  sz      Zero terminated String
  tm      Text metric
  u       Unsigned int
  ul      Unsigned long (ULONG)
  w       WORD (unsigned short)
  x,y     x, y coordinates (short)
</FONT> </PRE>

<p>
These are often combined, as in:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  pszMyString    A pointer to a string.
  m_pszMyString  A pointer to a string that is a data member of a class.
</FONT> </PRE>

<p>
Other conventions are:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  CMyClass          Prefix 'C' for C++ class names.
  COMyObjectClass   Prefix 'CO' for COM object class names.
  CFMyClassFactory  Prefix 'CF' for COM class factory names.
  IMyInterface      Prefix 'I' for COM interface class names.
  CImpIMyInterface  Prefix 'CImpI' for COM interface implementation classes.
</FONT> </PRE>

<p>
Because the COM Tutorial Samples are meant to be study devices in
addition to being coding skeletons, some consistent conventions for
comment header blocks are used. They are:

<h4>File Header</h4>

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
/*+==========================================================================

  Summary:   Brief summary of the file contents and purpose.

  Functions: Functions exported (in source files).

  Origin:    Indications of where content may have come from. This is not
             a change history but rather a reference to the
             editor-inheritance behind the content or other indications
             about the origin of the source.

 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
All of these comment block conventions have consistent beginning and
ending token strings. This consistency supports automatic processing of
the headers in some fashion. For example, AWK scripts can be written to
filter out only the function headers into a separate text file that can
serve the basis for a specification document. Similarly, tools like the
unsupported AUTODUCK utility (currently available on the Microsoft
Developer Network Development Library CD-ROM) can be used to process the
comment blocks in these headers. The following beginning and ending tokens
are used:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  /*+     File Header Begin
  +*/     File Header End

  /*-     Plain comment block Header Begin
  -*/     Plain comment block Header End

  /*C     Class Header Begin
  C*/     Class Header End

  /*M     Method Header Begin
  M*/     Method Header End

  /*F     Function Header Begin
  F*/     Function Header End

  /*I     Interface Header Begin
  I*/     Interface Header End

  /*O     COM Object Class Header Begin
  O*/     COM Object Class Header End
</FONT> </PRE>

<p>
These headers can also be used as visual cues for rapid scanning of source
files. They also provide convenience for rapidly getting to some source
location if you set up search strings in your editor and then 'repeat last
search' to quickly locate these headers. For example, the search string
&quot;M+M&quot; will locate the start of method headers, and
&quot;M-M&quot; will locate the beginning of the actual method
definition/implementation code.
