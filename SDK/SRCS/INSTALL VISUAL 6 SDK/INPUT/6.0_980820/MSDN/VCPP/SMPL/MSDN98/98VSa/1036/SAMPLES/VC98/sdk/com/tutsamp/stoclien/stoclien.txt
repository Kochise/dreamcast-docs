STOCLIEN - Client of structured storage server


SUMMARY
=======

The STOCLIEN sample introduces a simple drawing application. The user can
use a mouse or tablet device to do free-form drawing in the client window.
The color and width of the electronic ink can be chosen, and the drawings
can be saved in files.

The functionality is externally similar to other "scribble" C++ tutorial
samples. The difference in the STOCLIEN/STOSERVE samples is an internal
architecture based on COM technology. A clear architectural distinction is
kept between COM client and COM server. A COPaper COM object encapsulates
only the server-based storage of the drawing paper data: No graphical user
interface (GUI) behavior is provided on the server side. All GUI behavior
is isolated in the client. The data managment and storage features of
COPaper objects are available only through an COM custom interface,
IPaper.

STOCLIEN can load and save its drawings in the structured storage of COM
compound files. The principal focus of the STOCLIEN sample is how the
client uses this structured storage and how it directs a server component
to use this storage. The programming of structured storage services is
shown in the sample.

The STOCLIEN sample creates and uses the connectable COPaper COM object
that is provided as the CLSID_DllPaper component in the STOSERVE server.
The STOCLIEN client creates a COPaper object and controls it through the
IPaper interface that the object exposes. STOCLIEN obtains drawing data
from the user and graphically represents it in a window that it manages.
STOCLIEN uses COPaper's IPaper interface to save the drawing data in
COPaper and to direct file storage operations on this data.

STOCLIEN cooperates with the COPaper to load and save COPaper's drawing
data. STOCLIEN obtains an IStorage interface for the storage object in a
compound file. In its load and save operations, STOCLIEN passes a pointer
to this IStorage interface to COPaper in the server. COPaper uses the
provided IStorage to create streams in the storage. COPaper can then use
the standard IStream interface for reading and writing the drawing data it
manages.

COPaper only manages the drawing data; it performs no GUI actions.
STOCLIEN provides the GUI for the drawing application. It encapsulates
this in a central CGuiPaper C++ object.

STOCLIEN also implements the custom IPaperSink interface in a COPaperSink
COM object and connects this interface to an appropriate connection point
in the server's COPaper object. COPaper uses the connected IPaperSink
interface to send notifications back to STOCLIEN. The normal GUI
repainting of COPaper's drawing data is done in STOCLIEN using COPaper's
connectable object technology.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of STOCLIEN, see the
Code Tour section in STOCLIEN.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of STOCLIEN, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
STOCLIEN.HTM. To read STOCLIEN.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the STOCLIEN lesson in the table of lessons. You can
also achieve the same thing by clicking the STOCLIEN.HTM file after
locating the main tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also
STOSERVE.HTM in the main tutorial directory for more details on how
STOSERVE works and exposes its services to STOCLIEN. You must build the
STOSERVE DLL before building STOCLIEN. The makefile for STOSERVE
automatically registers that server in the system registry, so you must
build STOSERVE before attempting to run STOCLIEN.

For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

Usage
-----

STOCLIEN is an application that you can execute directly from Windows in
the normal manner or from the Command Prompt window. STOCLIEN accepts an
optional file name parameter on the command line. For example:

  STOCLIEN c:\drawings\drawing.pap

Where drawing.pap is a compound file containing DllPaper-compatible
structured storage of drawing data. If no command line file name parameter
is specified, STOCLIEN uses the default file name STOCLIEN.PAP and
attempts to open it in the same directory as the executing STOCLIEN.EXE.
