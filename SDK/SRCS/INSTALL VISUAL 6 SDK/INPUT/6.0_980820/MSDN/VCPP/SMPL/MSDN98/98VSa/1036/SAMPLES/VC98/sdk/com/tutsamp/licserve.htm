<h2><a name="LICSERVE">LICSERVE - DLL Licensed Server</a></h2>

<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
The LICSERVE sample introduces licensed components. LICSERVE modifies the
COCruiseCar component of the DLLSERVE code sample and houses it as a
licensed LicCruiseCar component in the LICSERVE.DLL COM server. This
in-process server provides the components LicCruiseCar and LicCarSample.
LicCarSample is the utility component that allows clients access to this
server's logged behavior.

<P>
LICSERVE provides class factories for each of these components. The class
factory for the LicCruiseCar component implements IClassFactory2, instead of
the usual IClassFactory, to provide the licensing mechanism for this
component. The LicCarSample component is not licensed and thus implements
IClassFactory.

<P>
In the series of COM tutorial code samples, LICSERVE works with the
LICCLIEN code sample to illustrate LICSERVE's COM server facilities for
creating licensed components and supporting the subsequent manipulation of
those components by the LICCLIEN.EXE client.

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of LICSERVE, see the
Code Tour section in LICSERVE.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of LICSERVE, see the Usage section in LICSERVE.HTM. To
read LICSERVE.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the LICSERVE lesson in the table of lessons. You can also achieve
the same thing by clicking the LICSERVE.HTM file after locating the main
tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also LICCLIEN.HTM in the
main tutorial directory for more details on the LICCLIEN client
application and how it works with LICSERVE.EXE itself. You must build
LICSERVE.DLL before building or running LICCLIEN. LICSERVE's makefile
automatically registers LICSERVE's components in the system registry.
These components must be registered before LICSERVE is available to
outside COM clients as a server for those components. This registration is
done using the REGISTER.EXE utility built in the earlier REGISTER lesson.
To build or run LICSERVE, you should build the REGISTER code sample first.

<P>
For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE
is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

<P>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<P>
LICSERVE is a DLL that is meant to be used primarily as a licensed COM
server. Though it can be implicitly loaded by linking to its associated
.LIB file, it is normally used after an explicit LoadLibrary call, usually
from COM's CoGetClassObject function. Servers like LICSERVE are registered
in the registry. To use LICSERVE in a COM client program, a client does not
need to include LICSERVE.H or link to LICSERVE.LIB. A COM client of LICSERVE
obtains access solely through its components' CLSIDs and COM services. For
LICSERVE, those CLSIDs are CLSID_LicCruiseCar and CLSID_LicCarSample. The
LICCLIEN sample shows how this is done with the LicCruiseCar component that
is licensed in the LICSERVE server.

<P>
The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the LICSERVE directory:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  nmake register
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This assumes that you have a compilation environment set up. If not, you
can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the LICSERVE directory.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  ..\register\register.exe licserve.dll
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
These registration commands require a prior build of the REGISTER sample
in this series, as well as a prior build of LICSERVE.DLL.

<P>
In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Win32 Platform SDK and Visual
C++&reg; include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which can be used in a similar
fashion to register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.

<h4>Run the Sample</h4>

<p>
The client sample and other related samples must be compiled before
you can run the client. For more details on building the samples, see
<a href="using.htm#building">
Building the Code Samples.</a>

<P>
If you have already built the appropriate samples, LICCLIEN.EXE is the
client executable to run for this sample.

<P>
Depending on the security level of your browser you may see a dialog
allowing you to either open the .EXE file or save it to disk. Click the
"Open it" choice and then click the OK button.

<P>
This code sample is based on the code in the DLLSERVE lesson. This lesson
begins with the COCruiseCar component studied in DLLSERVE lesson and
modifies it into a licensed component, COLicCruiseCar, which is housed in
the LICSERVE server. The bulk of this work is done in the class factory,
where the IClassFactory2 interface is implemented instead of the usual
IClassFactory interface. COLicCruiseCar is an aggregatable COM object
that also aggregates the COCar COM object provided by the in-process
server DLLSERVE. The LICSERVE in-process server uses this unlicensed COM
object from another in-process server to provide the licensed
COLicCruiseCar component to outside clients. The next lesson, LICCLIEN,
illustrates just such a client.

<P>
LICSERVE also provides the necessary utility COM object, COLicCarSample,
to permit trace logging of behavior inside LICSERVE components to appear
in the client's trace logging display.

<P>
The main objective of the LICSERVE and LICCLIEN code samples is to show
the mechanisms required to license and verify licensing of a component
(LicCruiseCar).

<P>
LICSERVE uses many of the utility classes and services provided by
APPUTIL. For more details on APPUTIL, study the APPUTIL library's source
code in the sibling APPUTIL directory and APPUTIL.HTM in the main tutorial
directory.

<P>
Like the DLLSERVE server, LICSERVE is self-registering. See the DLLSERVE
lesson for more details on this process. For LICSERVE, the code for
self-registration is in the DllRegisterServer and DllUnregisterServer
functions in LICSERVE.CPP. Two new components are registered,
CLSID_LicCruiseCar and CLSID_LicCarSample. These CLSIDs are defined in
the global CARGUIDS.H in the \INC sibling directory.

<P>
In this lesson we'll concentrate on what it takes to license the
COLicCruiseCar component. Other aspects of this code sample are very much
the same as the DLLSERVE code sample.

<P>
We start the tour in LICSERVE.CPP. There is nothing significantly
different with the DllGetClassObject and DllCanUnloadNow functions that
were studied in DLLSERVE. However, there is something significantly new
in the DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH case of the DllMain function. Here is DllMain:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  BOOL WINAPI DllMain(
                HINSTANCE hDllInst,
                DWORD fdwReason,
                LPVOID lpvReserved)
  {
    BOOL bResult = TRUE;

    // Dispatch this main call based on the reason it was called.
    switch (fdwReason)
    {
      case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
        // The DLL is being loaded for the first time by a given process.
        // Perform per-process initialization here. If the initialization
        // is successful, return TRUE; if unsuccessful, return FALSE.
        bResult = FALSE;
        if (UnicodeOk())
        {
          // Instantiate the CServer utility class.
          g_pServer = new CServer;
          if (NULL != g_pServer)
          {
            // Remember the DLL Instance handle.
            g_pServer-&gt;m_hDllInst = hDllInst;

            // Create a MsgBox object.
            g_pServer-&gt;m_pMsgBox = new CMsgBox;
            if (NULL != g_pServer-&gt;m_pMsgBox)
            {
              // Check for valid Machine License.
              g_pServer-&gt;CheckLicense();
              bResult = TRUE;
            }
          }
        }
        break;

      case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        ...
        break;

      case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
        ...
        break;

      case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
        ...
        break;

      default:
        break;
    }

    return (bResult);
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The significant difference here is the g_pServer-&gt;CheckLicense call.
CheckLicense is a new licensing-related method of the server control
object (CServer). Here is what the CServer class declaration in SERVER.H
looks like with added support for license management.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  class CServer
  {
    public:
      CServer(void);
      ~CServer(void);

      void Lock(void);
      void Unlock(void);
      void ObjectsUp(void);
      void ObjectsDown(void);
      BOOL CheckLicense(void);

      // A place to store the handle to loaded instance of this DLL module.
      HINSTANCE m_hDllInst;

      // A place to store a client's parent window.
      HINSTANCE m_hWndParent;

      // A Pointer to a Message Box object.
      CMsgBox* m_pMsgBox;

      // Global DLL Server living Object count.
      LONG m_cObjects;

      // Global DLL Server Client Lock count.
      LONG m_cLocks;

      // The Machine License key string for the LICSERVE server.
      CHAR m_szLicenseKey[MAX_LICENSEKEY];

      // Length of the global g_szLicenseKey string.
      UINT m_cLicenseLen;

      // Machine license verified.
      BOOL m_bLicensed;
  };
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The CheckLicense method returns TRUE if the license was verified and FALSE
if not. An ASCII m_szLicenseKey string is defined to contain a unique
license key string that is hard-coded for this server. This key string
provides what is called the machine license for the server. In this
scheme, the entire server is licensed for use on the machine through this
one key. For those components housed within the server that you want to
license, you implement their class factories using IClassFactory2. We'll
look at this shortly.

<P>
The key string is initialized in the CServer::CServer constructor (in
SERVER.CPP) as follows:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  CServer::CServer(void)
  {
    // Init the Server License Key string.
    lstrcpyA(
      m_szLicenseKey,
      &quot;LICSERVE 1.0 - Component Server - Copyright 1996-1997 Microsoft Corp.&quot;);

    // Zero the Object and Lock counts for this attached process.
    m_cObjects = 0;
    m_cLocks = 0;

    return;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
We force the use of the ASCII lstrcpyA function because the key string is
specified in CServer as a CHAR ASCII string and not as a more general
TCHAR, which would compile to either Unicode or ANSI. This reliance on
ASCII is merely a convenience, since the license file (where the matching
license key string should be found, in this case LICSERVE.LIC) is also
provided by us--the builders of this server--as part of the server. We
control the format of the license file. To read an ASCII text file and
match two ASCII text strings is easy. However, we could make the license
key a Unicode or even an encrypted binary sequence if we were so inclined.

<P>
The internal license key used in this code sample is chosen to match the
first text line of an outside ASCII text file. Here is that entire
LICSERVE.LIC text file.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">

 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
If this file's copyright line is tampered with in any way, or if the file
is absent, the server's class factories won't create any instances of
their respective components. The presence of this file constitutes a
machine license for the LICSERVE comonents. We'll explore this idea in
more detail later.

<P>
CServer also has two other new data members, m_cLicenseLen and
m_bLicensed. They are for later use by the various license-related methods
in the server. CServer::CheckLicense assigns both of these values. Here is
CheckLicense (in SERVER.CPP):

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  BOOL CServer::CheckLicense(void)
  {
    TCHAR  szPath[MAX_PATH];
    CHAR   szLicKeyRead[MAX_LICENSEKEY];
    UINT   cbRead;
    ULONG  cbWasRead;
    UINT   cb;
    HANDLE hFile;

    // Assume license not verified to start.
    m_bLicensed = FALSE;

    // Assume the license key string is ASCII and count its length.
    m_cLicenseLen = cb = lstrlenA(m_szLicenseKey);

    // Get the module path. Then parse and replace DLL extension with LIC.
    MakeFamilyPath(m_hDllInst, szPath, TEXT(LICENSE_FILE_EXT));

    // Open the xx.LIC file and read in and check the license key for
    // a match.
    hFile = CreateFile(
              szPath,
              GENERIC_READ,
              FILE_SHARE_READ,
              NULL,
              OPEN_EXISTING,
              FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,
              NULL);

    if (INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE != hFile)
    {
      cbRead = cb * sizeof(CHAR);
      ReadFile(hFile, szLicKeyRead, cbRead, &amp;cbWasRead, NULL);
      CloseHandle(hFile);
      if (cbRead == cbWasRead)
        if (0 == memcmp(m_szLicenseKey, szLicKeyRead, cb))
          m_bLicensed = TRUE;
    }

    LOGF1(&quot;P: CServer::CheckLicense. bLicensed=%i.&quot;, m_bLicensed);

    return m_bLicensed;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
CheckLicense first calculates the length of the internally held license
key string and assigns it to m_bLicenseLen for later use. It then calls
APPUTIL's MakeFamilyPath function to construct the path name to the
LICSERVE.LIC license file. It calls the CreateFile function to open
this license file for reading. If successful, it calls the ReadFile
function to read a series of bytes from the front of the file. The number
of bytes read is equal to the length of the internally stored license key
string (the length assigned above to m_cLicenseLen). This program logic
assumes that a copy of the internally held license key is stored at the
beginning of the LICSERVE.LIC file. The call to memcmp, a C standard
library function, compares the internal license key with the one read from
the .LIC file.

<P>
If the two license key strings match, m_bLicensed is set to TRUE. If they
do not, m_bLicensed is FALSE. The m_bLicensed Boolean variable specifies
if the server module has verified the presence of the machine license file
and is used by licensing functionality in the server (for example, the
class factories). We will see how this variable is used later in this code
tour.

<P>
Class factories are where the core of the licensing mechanism resides. For
those components we want to protect with a license in this server, we
implement IClassFactory2 instead of IClassFactory in their class factory.
In this server we are protecting only one component, COLicCruiseCar. Here
is the class factory declaration for the class factory CFLicCruiseCar in
FACTORY.H:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">

<P>
A CreateLicCruiseCar method is provided as an internal unconditional
create function. This method creates a new COLicCruiseCar object
regardless of any licensing conditions. It is conditionally called from
two different license-aware creation methods, CreateInstance and
CreateInstanceLic.

<P>
The IClassFactory interface is implemented as the nested class
CImpIClassFactory, a pattern that should be familiar by now. As noted
above, the CImpIClassFactory implementation is derived from
IClassFactory2. Thus it must implement three methods (GetLicInfo,
RequestLicKey, and CreateInstanceLic) in addition to the usual
IClassFactory methods CreateInstance and LockServer. The rest of this
CFLicCruiseCar class factory declaration is essentially the same as that
presented in the DLLSERVE code sample's CFCruiseCar class factory. The
CFCruiseCar::QueryInterface does one thing worthy of comment.

      // We've handed out a pointer to the interface so obey the COM rules
      // and AddRef the reference count.
      ((LPUNKNOWN)*ppv)-&gt;AddRef();
      hr = NOERROR;
    }

    return (hr);
  }

<P>
Since IClassFactory2 is derived from abstract base class IClassFactory, if
we implement IClassFactory2 we must also implement IClassFactory methods.
If QueryInterface requests either the IClassFactory or IClassFactory2
interface, we can safely return the same pointer, the one to the
IClassFactory2 interface implementation.

<P>
We next turn to the implementations of the licensing-aware class factory
methods. Here is the IClassFactory CreateInstance method in FACTORY.CPP.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP CFLicCruiseCar::CImpIClassFactory::CreateInstance(
                 IUnknown* pUnkOuter,
                 REFIID riid,
                 PPVOID ppv)
  {
    HRESULT hr = CLASS_E_NOTLICENSED;

    if (g_pServer-&gt;m_bLicensed)
      hr = m_pBackObj-&gt;CreateLicCruiseCar(pUnkOuter, riid, ppv);
    else
    {
      LOG(&quot;P: CImpIClassFactory::CreateInstance. No Machine License.&quot;);
      g_pServer-&gt;m_pMsgBox-&gt;ErrorID(IDS_NOLICENSE);
    }

    return hr;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The unconditional CreateLicCruiseCar function is called only if
CheckLicense previously set m_bLicensed to TRUE when the server was first
initialized for a given process. If the machine license was not verified,
CheckLicense displays an error message indicating to the user that the
client application is attempting to run with a component that is not
licensed for use on this machine.

<P>
GetLicInfo is one of the methods required by IClassFactory2:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP CFLicCruiseCar::CImpIClassFactory::GetLicInfo(
                 LPLICINFO pLicInfo)
  {
    HRESULT hr = NOERROR;

    LOG(&quot;P: CFLicCruiseCar::CImpIClassFactory::GetLicInfo.&quot;);

    if (NULL != pLicInfo)
    {
      pLicInfo-&gt;cbLicInfo = sizeof(LICINFO);

      // Inform whether RequestLicKey will work.
      pLicInfo-&gt;fRuntimeKeyAvail = g_pServer-&gt;m_bLicensed;

      // Inform whether the standard CreateInstance will work.
      pLicInfo-&gt;fLicVerified = g_pServer-&gt;m_bLicensed;
    }
    else
      hr = E_POINTER;

    return hr;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This method writes appropriate values to the LICINFO structure whose
address is passed in the pLicInfo parameter. The two important values in
this structure are fRuntimeKeyAvail and fLicVerified. The fRuntimeKeyAvail
member is set to the value that was returned by CheckLicense. This flag
indicates in advance whether the RequestLicKey method can be attempted. If
the server found no machine license, it will not (and should not) provide
the internal license key to any caller of the RequestLicKey method. The
fLicVerified member indicates whether the server verified that there is at
least a machine license for the server.

<P>
Here is the IClassFactory2 RequestLicKey method (again in file FACTORY.CPP).

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP CFLicCruiseCar::CImpIClassFactory::RequestLicKey(
                 DWORD dwReserved,
                 BSTR* pbstrKey)
  {
    HRESULT hr = CLASS_E_NOTLICENSED;
    OLECHAR szLicKey[MAX_LICENSEKEY];

    LOG(&quot;P: CFLicCruiseCar::CImpIClassFactory::RequestLicKey.&quot;);

    // Only return the license key if the server machine license was
    // verified.
    if (g_pServer-&gt;m_bLicensed)
    {
      // Convert our ANSI license string to Wide Char and then alloc as
      // a BSTR.
      mbstowcs(szLicKey, g_pServer-&gt;m_szLicenseKey,
      g_pServer-&gt;m_cLicenseLen); *pbstrKey = SysAllocString(szLicKey);
      hr = (NULL != *pbstrKey) ? NOERROR : E_OUTOFMEMORY;
    }

    return hr;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
RequestLicKey returns the license key in the form of a BSTR. In 32-bit
COM, these basic strings are like zero-terminated Unicode strings, except
that they are preceded by a DWORD value indicating the length of the
string. BSTR variables are used heavily in OLE Automation and have come to
us from Microsoft Visual Basic&reg;. COM/OLE provides a set of API
functions to manipulate these BSTRs, such as the SysAllocString call
above. There is also a matching SysFreeString function that must be called
to free these allocated BSTRs.

<P>
The RequestLicKey method is used to request a run-time license key from
the server. The idea is that during development, the developer (or a
development tool) can request from the server a copy of its internal
license key. This request can succeed only if there is already a machine
license with the server. Once obtained, the license key copy can be
stored persistently for use by a client application that uses and ships
with the server. Later, the client application can use this persistently
stored license key to create a licensed component by calling the
CreateInstanceLic method, which accepts the key as an argument.

<P>
The client application can succeed at this even if the machine license
file does not accompany the server. In this situation, the normal call to
IClassFactory::CreateInstance would fail, but a call to
IClassFactory2::CreateInstanceLic would succeed.

<P>
Here is the IClassFactory2 CreateInstanceLic method in FACTORY.CPP.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  STDMETHODIMP CFLicCruiseCar::CImpIClassFactory::CreateInstanceLic(
                 IUnknown* pUnkOuter,
                 IUnknown* pUnkReserved,
                 REFIID riid,
                 BSTR bstrKey,
                 PPVOID ppvCob)
  {
    HRESULT hr;
    BOOL    bMatch = FALSE;
    BSTR    bstrTemp;
    UINT    cch = g_pServer-&gt;m_cLicenseLen;
    OLECHAR szLicKey[MAX_LICENSEKEY];

    *ppvCob = NULL;

    // Convert our ANSI license string to Wide Char and then alloc as BSTR.
    mbstowcs(szLicKey, g_pServer-&gt;m_szLicenseKey, cch);
    bstrTemp = SysAllocString(szLicKey);
    if (NULL != bstrTemp)
    {
      if (NULL != bstrKey)
        bMatch = (0 == memcmp(bstrTemp, bstrKey, cch * sizeof(OLECHAR)));

      SysFreeString(bstrTemp);

      if (bMatch)
        hr = m_pBackObj-&gt;CreateLicCruiseCar(pUnkOuter, riid, ppvCob);
      else
      {
        LOG(&quot;P: CImpIClassFactory::CreateInstanceLic. No Runtime License.&quot;);
        g_pServer-&gt;m_pMsgBox-&gt;ErrorID(IDS_NORUNLICENSE);
        hr = CLASS_E_NOTLICENSED;
      }
    }
    else
      hr = E_OUTOFMEMORY;

    return hr;
  }
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The license key is passed as a BSTR, so we convert the internal license
key string to a BSTR and then compare the two. If there is a match, we
have a run-time license and can create an instance of the COLicCruiseCar
and pass back the requested interface on it. If there is not a match, an
error message is displayed to inform the user that the component is not
licensed for run-time use.

<P>
What we've seen so far is that when the server DLL is attached to a
process, it checks for the presence of the machine .LIC license file and
tries to match its internal key to the key in the license file. If a match
is found, the CFLicCruiseCar class factory will permit a normal call to
IClassFactory::CreateInstance. Otherwise, it won't. In this tutorial
sample, if the machine license is found, the client can also call
IClassFactory2::RequestLicKey to obtain a copy of the internal license
key. It can store this run-time license key to later create an instance by
calling the IClassFactory2::CreateInstanceLic method.  In actual
applications the client would not call RequestLicKey. This call would be
used during development only to obtain the run-time license key for the
component in the server.

<P>
Run-time licensing is intended for component servers that are purchased in
binary form by a developer and resold with the developer's client
application. During development, the developer uses some tool that acts as
a temporary client of the licensed component and calls
IClassFactory2::RequestLicKey to obtain the run-time license key. This
call would succeed because a machine license for the component would be
present as part of the development kit purchased by the developer for the
component. The developer would then use the run-time license key value in
compiling the retail client application.

<P>
In a typical licensing scheme, the run-time key value is compiled into the
client executable and used at run-time in calls to
IClassFactory2::CreatInstanceLic. Then, when the retail client application
is later sold by the developer in a package with the accompanying server
component, the machine license file is not included in the package. In
this case, only the client with the proper built-in, run-time license key
will work with the resold component. This protects the component vendor
from unauthorized copies of the component working with any client
application that can call the component's IClassFactory::CreateInstance.
Since the machine license file is absent, IClassFactory::CreateInstance
will fail, returning error CLASS_E_NOTLICENSED.

<P>
Before leaving the class factories in FACTORY.CPP, we should note that an
implementation of a CFLicCarSample factory is provided in a way very
similar to what was studied in the DLLSERVE lesson. As before, this
CarSample utility component is used to display trace logging of this
server's behavior in the client's logging display and to provide an About
dialog box from the server.
