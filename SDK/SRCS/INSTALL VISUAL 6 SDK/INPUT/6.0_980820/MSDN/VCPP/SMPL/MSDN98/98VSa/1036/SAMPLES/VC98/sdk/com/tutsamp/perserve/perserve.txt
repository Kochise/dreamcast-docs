PERSERVE - IPersistStream Persistent Object Server


SUMMARY
=======

The PERSERVE sample introduces the COPageList COM object, which
encapsulates a page list. The list contains elements that correspond to
pages of text or drawing data. COPageList objects expose a set of
interfaces that make the objects connectable, persistent managers of the
list data. Client access to this data is available through an IPageList
custom interface. COPageList implements the IPageList interface.

A clear architectural distinction is kept between client and server.
COPageList provides no graphical user interface (GUI). Instead, the
COPageList object relies on the client for all GUI behavior.

The PERCLIEN client provides the GUI display and manages the list of pages
the content of which are stored in a compound file that contains both the
contents of the list and of each page in that list. The user of PERCLIEN
can edit the content of two type of pages: Text pages and drawing pages.
Text pages have text data that the user can edit using a simple windowed
text editor. Drawing pages have drawing data that the user can edit using
free-form, scribble-like functionality based on the earlier STOSERVE and
STOCLIEN samples. Both types of editing are done in separate client
windows. The details of the client are covered in the PERCLIEN sample. For
more information, see PERCLIEN.HTM.

Storage in the compound file is achieved because the components provide
persistent COM objects that encapsulate the page list and edited page
data. PERSERVE houses a persistent object that encapsulates the single
page list kept in each compound file containing such pages. PERTEXT houses
a persistent object that encapsulates the edited text data for each text
page. PERDRAW houses a persistent object that encapsulates the drawing
data for each drawing page.

The COPageList object in the this PERSERVE sample encapsulates the
persistent page list data. COPageList implements the IPersistStream
standard interface to expose control of the page list storage located in
the client-provided stream of a compound file. The COTextPage object in
the PERTEXT sample encapsulates the data of an edited text page.
COTextPage implements the IPersistStreamInit standard interface to expose
control of the text data storage that is located in the client-provided
stream of a compound file. In contrast to these stream-based persistent
objects, the CODrawPage object in the PERDRAW sample encapsulates the
persistent drawing-ink data. CODrawPage implements the IPersistStorage
standard interface to expose control of the drawing's ink data storage
located in the client-provided substorage of a compound file.

This code sample focuses primarily on COPageList's implementation of the
IPersistStream interface to provide stream-based persistence for a COM
object. PERSERVE works with the PERCLIEN code sample to illustrate the
joint use by client and server of this IPersistStream-based persistence.

COPageList's support for object persistence is the primary means
of storing the page list data. COPageList stores its list data in a
stream under the root storage of a structured-storage compound file. The
compound file has a unique format because of the various streams and
storages used. The client identifies these compound files as page files
with a .PAG extension. Only one page-list stream is present in each page
file. The client controls the use of the containing compound file and
provides COPageList with an IStream pointer for its use in loading and
saving its list data in the compound file. The IStream pointer is passed
to COPageList in method calls to the IPersistStream interface.

COPageList also exposes an IPageList custom interface to manipulate the
encapsulated list data. IPageList exposes the Get, Set, Add, Delete, and
Clear methods.

Connectable object features are also supported in COPageList. The
IConnectionPointContainer interface is exposed, and an appropriate
connection point is implemented. In this context, an outgoing custom
IPageListSink interface is declared to send notifications to the client.

The two IPageList and IPageListSink custom interfaces are declared in
IPAGES.H located in the common INC directory. PAGEGUID.H, which contains
the GUIDs for the interfaces and objects, is located in that same
directory.

The PERSERVE sample uses the CThreaded facility in APPUTIL to achieve
thread safety in the server housing and the class factory. Because
PERSERVE.DLL is generally accessed from a Single Threaded Apartment (STA)
as an in-process server, COPageList instances are not coded as
thread-safe. The CLSID_PageList component is registered as supporting the
apartment threading model.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of PERSERVE, see the
Code Tour section in PERSERVE.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of PERSERVE.DLL, see the Usage section in PERSERVE.HTM.
To read PERSERVE.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the PERSERVE lesson in the table of lessons. You can also do the
same thing by double-clicking the PERSERVE.HTM file after locating the
main tutorial directory in Windows Explorer. See also PERCLIEN.HTM in the
main tutorial directory for more details on the PERCLIEN client
application and how it works with PERSERVE.DLL. You must build
PERSERVE.DLL before running the PERCLIEN sample.

The PERSERVE server provides a PageList component that can create
instances of the COPageList COM object. COPageList is housed in the
PERSERVE.DLL in-process server and is made publicly available as a custom
COM component. Like all other servers in this tutorial series,
PERSERVE.DLL is a self-registering COM server. It makes the COPageList
object type available to clients as the PageList component in the PERSERVE
server using a CLSID_PageList registration in the Registry.

PERSERVE's makefile automatically registers its PageList COM component in
the registry, which it must do before clients can use PERSERVE.DLL as a
server for the PageList component. This self-registration is started in
the makefile using the REGISTER.EXE utility built in the REGISTER sample.
To build or run PERSERVE.DLL, you must build the REGISTER code sample
first.

For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

Usage
-----

To use PERSERVE, a client program does not need to include PERSERVE.H or
link to PERSERVE.LIB. A COM client of PERSERVE obtains access solely
through COM services and the PageList object's CLSID. For PERSERVE, that
CLSID is CLSID_PageList (defined in file PAGEGUID.H in the INC sibling
directory). For more information about how the client obtains this access,
see the PERCLIEN code sample.

PERSERVE.DLL is intended primarily as a COM server. Although it can be
implicitly loaded by linking to its associated .LIB file, it is normally
used after an explicit LoadLibrary call, usually from within the
CoGetClassObject function. PERSERVE is a self-registering in-process
server.

The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the PERSERVE directory:

  nmake register

This assumes that you have a compilation environment set up. If not, you
can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the PERSERVE directory.

  ..\register\register.exe perserve.dll

These registration commands require a prior build of both the REGISTER
sample and PERSERVE.DLL.

In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Microsoft Platform SDK and Visual
C++ include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which you can use in a similar
fashion to register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.
