Before building the FrameWrk samples, you must run setenv.bat to 
make sure the Platform SDK include, bin, and lib directories are included 
first in your environment. 

Run 'nmake' to build a debug build, or 'nmake nodebug=1' to build a
nodebug (retail) build of the framework library.

After building the FrameWrk libraries you can build the other BaseCtl 
samples.
