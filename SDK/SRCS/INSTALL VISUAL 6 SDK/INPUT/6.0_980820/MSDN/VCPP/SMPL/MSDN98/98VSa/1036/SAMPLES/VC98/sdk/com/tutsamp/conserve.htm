<h2><a name="CONSERVE">CONSERVE - Connectable Object Server</a></h2>

<p>&#160;
<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<P>
The CONSERVE sample shows how to construct a connectable COM object,
COBall, in a thread-safe in-process server. To expose connectable object
features, COBall implements the standard COM interface,
IConnectionPointContainer. COBall also implements the custom interface,
IBall, that was introduced in the FRESERVE sample.

<P>
The principal focus of CONSERVE is the connectable object support in
COBall and how connected clients are notified of ball events. CONSERVE
works with the CONCLIEN client code sample.

<P>
CONSERVE's COBall implements a virtual moving ball similar to the one
coded in the FRESERVE sample. However, rather than FRESERVE's
free-threaded COM object, CONSERVE houses COBall in an apartment model
server. COBall defines the internal logic of a moving ball that exists
within a specified two-dimensional bounding rectangle. COBall provides
only a description of a ball. It is up to the client to create a graphical
representation based on the data managed in COBall.

<P>
Clients move the virtual ball using its IBall interface. COBall's internal
logic will bounce the ball when it collides with a boundary. The client
can obtain the ball's current position, size, and color to permit display
of the ball's moving image. The client can also use the connection
facilities of COBall to receive notifications of ball bounce events. The
CONCLIEN sample will use these connection facilities to produce various
sounds when the ball bounces.

<P>
CONSERVE uses the CThreaded facility in APPUTIL for thread safety, as in
the FRESERVE sample. COBall objects are derived from the CThreaded class
and inherit its OwnThis and UnOwnThis methods. These methods allow only
one thread at a time to have access to the CONSERVE server and to COBall
objects managed by the server.

<P>
For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of CONSERVE, see the
Code Tour section in CONSERVE.HTM. For details on setting up the
programmatic usage of CONSERVE, see the Usage section in CONSERVE.HTM. To
read CONSERVE.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial directory and
click the CONSERVE lesson in the table of lessons. You can also achieve
the same thing by clicking the CONSERVE.HTM file after locating the main
tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also CONCLIEN.HTM in the
main tutorial directory for more details on the CONCLIEN client
application and how it works with CONSERVE.DLL. You must build
CONSERVE.DLL before building or running CONCLIEN.

<P>
CONSERVE's makefile automatically registers the DllSndBall component in
the registry. This component must be registered before CONSERVE is
available to outside clients as a server for that component. This
self-registration is done using the REGISTER.EXE utility built in the
REGISTER lesson. To build or run CONSERVE, you should build the REGISTER
code sample first.

<P>
For details on setting up your system to build and test the code samples
in this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM. The supplied MAKEFILE is
Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the NMAKE
command in the Command Prompt window.

<P>
<h4>Usage</h4>

<P>
To use CONSERVE, a client program does not need to include CONSERVE.H or
link to CONSERVE.LIB. A client of CONSERVE obtains access solely through
its object's CLSID and COM services. For CONSERVE, that CLSID is
CLSID_DllSndBall (defined in BALLGUID.H in the \INC sibling directory).
The CONCLIEN code sample shows how the client obtains this access.

<P>
CONSERVE is a DLL that is intended primarily as an in-process server.
Although it can be implicitly loaded by linking to its associated .LIB
file, it is normally used after an explicit LoadLibrary call, usually from
within COM's CoGetClassObject function. CONSERVE is a self-registering
in-process server.

<P>
The makefile that builds this sample automatically registers the server in
the registry. You can manually initiate its self-registration by issuing
the following command at the command prompt in the CONSERVE directory:

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  nmake register
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
This assumes that you have a compilation environment set up. If not, you
can also directly invoke the REGISTER.EXE command at the command prompt
while in the CONSERVE directory.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  ..\register\register.exe conserve.dll
 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
These registration commands require a prior build of the REGISTER sample
in this series, as well as a prior build of CONSERVE.DLL.

<P>
In this series, the makefiles use the REGISTER.EXE utility from the
REGISTER sample. Recent releases of the Platform SDK and Visual C++&reg;
include a utility, REGSVR32.EXE, which can be used in a similar fashion to
register in-process servers and marshaling DLLs.

<h4>Run the Sample</h4>

<p>
The client sample and other related samples must be compiled before
you can run the client. For more details on building the samples, see
<a href="using.htm#building">
Building the Code Samples.</a>

<P>
If you have already built the appropriate samples, CONCLIEN.EXE is the
client executable to run for this sample.

Click here to run CONCLIEN.EXE.</a>

<P>
Depending on the security level of your browser you may see a dialog
allowing you to either open the .EXE file or save it to disk. Click the
"Open it" choice and then click the OK button.

CONSERVE uses many of the utility classes and services provided by
APPUTIL. For more details on APPUTIL, study the APPUTIL library's source
code in the sibling \APPUTIL directory and APPUTIL.HTM in the main
tutorial directory.

<P>
This sample is part of a graduated series of tutorial samples. This tour
assumes that you have some exposure to those previous samples. It does not
revisit earlier topics of basic interface implementation techniques, COM
object construction, in-process server construction, and class factory
construction. For information on these topics, study the earlier tutorial
samples.

<P>
The major topics covered in this code tour are:

<ul>
<li>An overview of how CONSERVE connectability works
<li>Connectable object mechanisms in COBall
<li>The connection point container in COBall
<li>The connection point object
<li>Event notification
<li>The connection enumerator object
<li>The connection point enumerator object
</ul>

<P>
The COBall object is the single object type managed by this CONSERVE
in-process server. COBall is constructed as a connectable COM object with
an implementation of the standard IConnectionPointContainer interface and
an implementation of the custom IBall interface.

<P>
COBall exposes the IBall interface so clients can perform a small set of
ball-related operations on an instance of COBall. Methods are exposed to
reset, move, and obtain current ball position, size, and color. This IBall
interface is the same interface used in the FRESERVE sample. See
FRESERVE.HTM for more details on the IBall interface.

<P>
The COBall object encapsulates data, such as position, size, and color,
that defines a moving ball. No graphical images are managed in COBall.
When a COBall object is initialized with a call to its Reset method, it is
given a rectangle (a Win32 RECT structure) that defines the boundaries
within which the ball may move. The COBall object contains coded logic to
move the ball within those boundaries, to bounce the ball off any boundary
when appropriate, and to provide clients with current data on the ball's
location, size, and color. A client can use the IBall interface to move
the ball and to obtain the data necessary to paint an image of the moving
ball.

<P>
COBall exposes the IConnectionPointContainer interface so clients can
connect to COBall to receive notifications of specified events that occur
in COBall. By exposing this interface, COBall becomes a connectable
object. A client can request this interface with a call to QueryInterface
and use it to obtain the object's connection points. The client
participation in this scheme is covered in the associated CONCLIEN sample.

<P>
Basically, the client implements what is called a sink object with a sink
interface. The sink interface receives event notifications from COBall
after the sink is properly connected to a COBall instance. The client
makes the connection by using a connection point object that is managed by
COBall. There can be numerous connection points on a connectable object.
In the CONSERVE sample, COBall has only one connection point, which
reports ball bounce events.

<P>
A connection point can support numerous client connections. The connection
point in COBall maintains an array of connections that can grow
dynamically at run time. We will see later in this tour how COBall
maintains and uses this array to broadcast event notifications.

<P>
To make COBall fully connectable, several COM object classes must be
implemented: COEnumConnectionPoints, COConnectionPoint, and
COEnumConnections. The implementation of the standard
IConnectionPointContainer interface within COBall is also necessary. The
COEnumConnectionPoints object exposes the standard IEnumConnectionPoints
interface so clients can enumerate or sequence through the connection
points of the connectable COM object. The COConnectionPoint object exposes
the standard IConnectionPoint interface so that clients can connect to the
connectable COM object using the connection point. The COEnumConnections
object exposes the standard IEnumConnections interface so clients can
enumerate through the current connections managed by a connection point.
In this CONSERVE sample, the bulk of the code for these implementations is
in files CONNECT.H and CONNECT.CPP. The rest of this tour will focus on
these implementations.

<P>
Enumeration objects are common in COM programming. The basic scheme relies
on a dynamically created enumeration object that exposes an interface used
for subsequent access to an enumerated sequence of other objects that are
managed by the object being enumerated. For example, the COBall
implementation of the IConnectionPointContainer interface has an
EnumConnectionPoints method. This method allows clients to enumerate the
connection points of the COBall object. It dynamically creates a special
object, COEnumConnectionPoints, whose sole purpose is to enable access by
the client through a standard IEnumConnectionPoint interface to an
enumerated sequence of the connection points. This interface is
implemented by the programmer in a COEnumConnectionPoints object. It has
Next, Skip, Reset, and Clone methods which clients can use to sequence
through the enumerated connection points. In this sample, connection
points themselves support enumeration of the connections they manage. A
COEnumConnections object can be dynamically created. On the same
programming model as IEnumConnectionPoints, COEnumConnections exposes an
IEnumConnections interface with Next, Skip, Reset, and Clone methods.

<P>
The COBall implementation of IConnectionPointContainer must provide the
FindConnectionPoint and EnumConnectionPoints methods. Once a client
obtains an IConnectionPointContainer interface on COBall, it can call
FindConnectionPoint to obtain a specific connection point, or it can call
EnumConnectionPoints to enumerate all connection points. Once the client
obtains a connection point, it can connect to it (Advise method),
disconnect from it (Unadvise method), enumerate all current connections to
that connection point (EnumConnections method), obtain the container of
the connection point (GetConnectionPointContainer method), and obtain the
outgoing interface of the client notification sink (GetConnectionInterface
method). When the client connects to a COBall connection point, it passes
a pointer to the sink interface on its sink object. The connection point
object maintains a dynamic list of such sink interfaces. When events occur
within COBall that require sending a notification to the sink in the
client, logic in COBall can use each connection point's sink interface
list to broadcast appropriate notifications.

<P>
In this connection scheme, the client implements sink objects for the
connection points it expects to find in COBall. On the server side, COBall
must implement the IConnectionPointContainer interface. This interface
implementation, in turn, requires certain other COM objects. Each
connection point requires a COConnectionPoint object. To enumerate
connection points in COBall requires a COEnumConnectionPoints object, and
to enumerate the connections of a connection point requires a
COEnumConnections object. We will cover enumerator objects later in this
code tour.

<P>
COBall's implementation of the IConnectionPointContainer interface is
coded in BALL.H and BALL.CPP. The construction of the COBall object is
based on techniques presented in earlier samples of this series. Nested
class declarations are used for the multiple interface implementations.
Here is the COBall class declaration in BALL.H.

<P>
The outer COBall class and the nested CImpIBall and
CImpIConnectionPointContainer classes are derived from CThreaded to
inherit the OwnThis thread safety mechanism. The methods of these classes
use this mechanism to ensure mutually exclusive access to their objects by
multiple threads. Though COBall is not registered as a free-threaded
component in this sample, it is coded for thread-safety and could
therefore easily be used in a free-threaded program.

<P>
Much of this COBall class declaration was presented in the FRESERVE
sample. The items related to connectable object support are the
CImpIConnectionPointContainer implementation, the COBall::NotifySinks
private method, and the COBall::m_aConnectionPoints array.

<P>
NotifySinks is an internal convenience method that consolidates the
broadcast to client sinks of all appropriate events occurring in COBall.
We will look at NotifySinks in detail later.

<P>
The m_aConnectionPoints array is COBall's main array of connection points.
In this sample it is declared with a compile-time constant,
MAX_CONNECTION_POINTS. This means that the connection points supported by
COBall are determined at compile time. The m_aConnectionPoints array is
initially assigned during COBall::Init in file BALL.CPP.

 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
The call to COBall::Init is done in COBall's class factory in the
CreateInstance method, which is called when a client asks COM to create an
instance of a DllSndBall object. The class factory for CONSERVE's
DllSndBall object, CFBall, is declared in FACTORY.H and implemented in
FACTORY.CPP. This factory code is adapted from many previous samples in
this series. Like COBall, CFBall is derived from IUnknown and CThreaded
using multiple inheritance. CThreaded gives the class factory its thread
safety using the OwnThis mechanism seen earlier.

<P>
This COBall::Init method creates the connection point object, initializes
it, and uses a QueryInterface call on the connection point to assign the
new connection point to COBall's connection point array. The
CONNPOINT_BALLSINK connection point is the only connection point currently
supported by COBall objects. To add other connection points would require
additional code in Init for each one. CONNPOINT_BALLSINK is a constant
defined in CONNECT.H. Similar constants would be needed for additional
connection points.

<P>
The COConnectionPoint object class is declared in CONNECT.H.

<P>
This code includes many of the fixtures that are common to COM objects
housed in an in-process server. For example, the member m_cRefs is the
object reference counter. IConnectionPoint is not implemented in
COConnectionPoint in the familiar pattern of nested class implementation.
Instead, COConnectionPoint is derived directly from IConnectionPoint. This
direct derivation can be done as a convenience because COConnectionPoint
objects are not aggregatable and are not exposed as public components
housed in this server. COConnectionPoint objects are managed as internal
objects within the server.

<P>
The m_pHostObj pointer is passed into the constructor for use later in the
connection point's GetConnectionPointContainer method.

<P>
The m_iidSink member variable stores a reference to the IID of the sink
interface in the client. This member is solely for the use of the
GetConnectionInterface method.

<P>
COConnectionPoint objects manage a dynamic list of current connections to
the connection point using the m_dwNextCookie, m_cConnections,
m_uiMaxIndex, and m_paConnections member variables. The m_paConnections
member points to the current dynamic array of connections. Each connection
in the array is represented by a COM-declared CONNECTDATA structure. The
structure contains the following.

<P> <PRE> <FONT FACE="COURIER" SIZE = "2">
  typedef struct tagCONNECTDATA
  {
    IUnknown* pUnk;
    DWORD     dwCookie;
  } CONNECTDATA;
 </FONT> </PRE>

<p>
The pUnk member contains the interface pointer for the sink in the client.
The dwCookie member contains a unique key used to designate the
connection.

<p>
The initial dynamic array of these elements is created by
COConnectionPoint::Init. Here is Init from CONNECT.CPP.

This implementation of Init creates an initial allocated array of empty
connection elements and assigns member m_paConnections as a pointer to
that array. The content of these array elements is assigned when
COConnectionPoint::Advise is called, and the content is cleared by
COConnectionPoint::Unadvise. Here is Advise from CONNECT.CPP.

<P>
Advise is called by a client to establish a connection of its sink
interface to the connection point of a connectable object. The client
passes a pointer to the IUnknown of its sink object and a pointer to a
&quot;cookie&quot; variable. Advise assigns a unique key value to this
client cookie variable and adds the new connection to the connection array
created by Init. The connection point maintains m_dwNextCookie as a
counter to provide such cookies. When a connection is properly assigned,
Advise also increments a counter of current live connections,
m_cConnections. Because these counters might be accessed by multiple
client threads, the entire COConnectionPoint class is derived from
CThreaded to permit the Advise and Unadvise methods to use the OwnThis
mechanism to ensure thread-safety. For details on the CThreaded class, see
APTSERVE.HTM and the APTSERVE code sample of this series.

<P>
Advise calls the GetSlot private method to obtain an index into the
connection array of an open slot. Here is GetSlot from CONNECT.CPP.

 </FONT> </PRE>

<P>
GetSlot first attempts to find an open slot in the existing array and will
return it if one is found. Such an open slot exists because a previous
client call to Unadvise cleared the entry. However, if the current array
is full and GetSlot can find no existing open slot, GetSlot will allocate
an entirely new larger array with room for ALLOC_CONNECTIONS more entries.
ALLOC_CONNECTIONS is a constant declared in CONNECT.H. The m_uiMaxIndex
member is used to maintain the current maximum index of the array. The
m_uiMaxIndex member stores the size of the array so any for loops that
iterate through the array always work, no matter how the size of the array
has changed in dynamic reallocations of the array.

<P>
The client calls Unadvise to disconnect its sink interface from the
connection point. Here is Unadvise from CONNECT.CPP.

Unadvise releases the sink interface of the specified connection and
sets the associated pointer to NULL, zeroes the associated cookie value,
and decrements the number of live connections. Unadvise is passed a cookie
value that was obtained by a previous call to Advise. This cookie value is
used to locate the connection in the connection array. The FindSlot
private method is called to find the array index to the connection entry
corresponding to the specified cookie value. Here is FindSlot from
CONNECT.CPP.

With an array of client sink connections established by client calls to
Advise, COBall can use the array to broadcast notifications to the client
sinks. We return to BALL.CPP to study notifications. Here is COBall::Move.

<P>
This implementation is very similar to that of the Move method presented
in the COBall object of the FRESERVE code sample. In the CONSERVE sample,
when the CONCLIEN client calls IBall::Move on this COBall object, COBall
has internal logic in the CheckBounce private method to determine if
certain events have occurred. CheckBounce returns a constant indicating
the event. Move uses this event constant to call the NotifySinks private
method. Here is NotifySinks from BALL.CPP.

<P>
Since this COBall object has one connection point determined at compile
time, NotifySinks can index into the connection point array for specific
connection points. In this case, only one connection point is known, and
its index is CONNPOINT_BALLSINK.

<P>
Once the connection point is obtained, a connection enumerator is used.
The connection point's EnumConnections method is called to obtain an
IEnumConnections interface pointer on a COEnumConnections object. A while
loop iterates through the connections with calls to pIEnum->Next. Once the
data for each connection is obtained, the client's sink interface is used
to make specific notification calls. In this case, the IBallSink interface
has methods to handle the BOUNCE_BOTTOM, BOUNCE_LEFT, BOUNCE_RIGHT, and
BOUNCE_BOTTOM events. The custom client sink interface was designed to
match the expected connection points in the connectable objects.

<P>
To ensure that the host connection point object remains in existence as
long as the COEnumConnections enumerator object, the m_pHostObj member is
used to delegate AddRef and Release calls. The value for m_pHostObj is
initially passed into COEnumConnections in its constructor. To support the
IEnumConnections interface, a current connection array index is maintained
in member m_iEnumIndex. The total number of connections in the array is
also retained in member m_cConnections. An internal copy of the connection
array is also kept by COEnumConnections. The m_paConnections member points
to this array.

<P>
The COEnumConnections::Init method assigns m_pHostObj, m_cConnections, and
m_iEnumIndex. The Init method also allocates and assigns an internal copy
of the connection array and assigns m_paConnections to point to it.

<P>
Enumerator objects offer the Next, Skip, Reset, and Clone methods of the
standard IEnumConnections interface. The IEnumConnections interface is
implemented directly by COEnumConnections rather than being coded as a
nested interface implementation. This is convenient for such ad hoc COM
objects as COEnumConnections, which are subordinate to the other objects
housed in the server and which are not components in their own right.

<P>
The COEnumConnections::Next method is called to return a specified number
of next connections from the connection array. Here is Next from
CONNECT.CPP.

  STDMETHODIMP COEnumConnections::Next(
                 ULONG cReq,

          m_paConnections[m_iEnumIndex].pUnk-&gt;AddRef();

        // the specified output receiving array.
        *paConnections = m_paConnections[m_iEnumIndex];
      }

<P>
Argument cReq is the number of connection items requested. Argument
paConnections is a pointer to a caller-allocated array of the CONNECTDATA
items requested. The caller must ensure that the array size is large
enough to accept the number of requested items. Argument pcEnumerated is a
pointer to a variable that will contain, upon return, the number of items
actually returned. Because copies of the connection data are being passed
back to the caller, AddRef must be called on the sink interface pointer in
each CONNECTDATA element.

<P>
The Skip method is called to start at the current enumeration index and
skip a specified number of connection entries. The Reset method is called
to reset the current enumeration index to 0. The Clone method is called to
create a new copy of the entire COEnumConnections object, with internal
connection array and index the same as the original.

<P>
Earlier in this tour we saw that COBall's connection points could also be
enumerated by a call to COBall's implementation of the
IConnectionPointContainer interface. IConnectionPointContainer has an
EnumConnectionPoints method that can be called by clients that want to
enumerate all the connection points of the connectable object. Unlike the
EnumConnections presented earlier, EnumConnectionPoints is not called by
any object within the CONSERVE server. The
IConnectionPointContainer::EnumConnectionPoints method relies on the
creation of a COEnumConnectionPoints COM object and works very similar to
the COEnumConnections just presented. It implements the
IEnumConnectionPoints interface with methods Next, Skip, Reset, and Clone.
You can study the source for COEnumConnectionPoints in files CONNECT.H and
CONNECT.CPP.
