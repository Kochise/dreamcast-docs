The Checkers.Frm sample demonstrates how to use a custom sendable form. It
is an executable (.EXE) server. It implements the minimum form interface
required to launch and send a form.

Installation
------------

The form has to be properly registered to be used my mail clients.
Run the command

    pdkin32 -f chkrform.cfg

to register the form in the local form registry. Then run the command

    regedit wcheck.reg

to register wcheck.exe as an OLE server for the form in the registry.
The path to the form's .EXE file has to be put in to the .REG file or
the system PATH.

For more information about installing and launching forms, see
the documentation for the form interfaces in the MAPI SDK.

To send the Checkers form to another user:

1. Select the Compose New Form command in your mail client.
2. Choose the checkers form in the Choose Form dialog.
3. Select a recipient in the address book.
4. Drag a checkers piece to make a move.

The form is sent automatically when the move is complete.


Known Problems
--------------

Data for many of the custom properties is not written to the
message, and the data that is written might not actually be 
meaningful.
