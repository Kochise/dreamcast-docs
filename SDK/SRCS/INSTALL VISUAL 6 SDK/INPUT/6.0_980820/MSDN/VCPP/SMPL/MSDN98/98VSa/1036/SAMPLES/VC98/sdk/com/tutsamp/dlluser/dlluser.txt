DLLUSER - DLL User Application Skeleton


SUMMARY
=======

The DLLUSER sample introduces the basic skeleton for an EXE that
implicitly loads a Win32 DLL and makes calls to it. In this case, DLLUSER
works with the DLLSKEL.DLL dynamic link library from the DLLSKEL lesson.
You must build DLLSKEL before you try to build DLLUSER.EXE, because the
DLLSKEL makefile copies the necessary DLLSKEL.H, DLLSKEL.LIB, and
DLLSKEL.DLL files it produces into the DLLUSER sibling directory.

For functional descriptions and a tutorial code tour of DLLUSER, see the
Code Tour section in DLLUSER.HTM. For details on the external user
operation of DLLUSER, see both the Usage and Operation sections in
DLLUSER.HTM. To read DLLUSER.HTM, run TUTORIAL.EXE in the main tutorial
directory and click the DLLUSER lesson in the table of lessons. You can
also achieve the same thing by clicking the DLLUSER.HTM file after
locating the main tutorial directory in the Windows Explorer. See also the
DLLSKEL.HTM file in the main tutorial directory for more details on how
DLLSKEL works and exposes its services to DLLUSER.

In general, to set up your system to build and test the code samples in
this COM Tutorial series, see TUTORIAL.HTM for details. The supplied
makefile is Microsoft NMAKE-compatible. To create a debug build, issue the
NMAKE command at the command prompt.

Usage
-----

This DLLUSER.EXE application is provided to interact with DLLSKEL.DLL.
DLLUSER recognizes no command line arguments. See the Operation section
below for more details.

Files          Description

DLLUSER.TXT    This file.
MAKEFILE       The generic makefile for building the code sample
               application of this tutorial lesson.
DLLUSER.H      The include file for the DLLUSER.EXE application. Contains
               class declarations, function prototypes, and resource
               identifiers.
DLLUSER.CPP    The main implementation file for DLLUSER.EXE. Has WinMain
               and CMainWindow implementation.
DLLUSER.RC     The DLLUSER.EXE application resource definition file.
DLLUSER.ICO    The icon resource for DLLUSER.EXE.
DLLSKEL.H      The include file for declaring as imported the service
               functions in DLLSKEL.DLL. This file is copied to the
               sibling ..\INC directory during the build of DLLSKEL.
DLLSKEL.LIB    The library file for use in linking to the function
               calls used in DLLSKEL.DLL. This file is copied to the
               sibling ..\LIB directory during the build of DLLSKEL.
DLLSKEL.DLL    The binary DLLSKEL dynamic link libary. This file is copied
               to this DLLUSER directory during the build of DLLSKEL.
