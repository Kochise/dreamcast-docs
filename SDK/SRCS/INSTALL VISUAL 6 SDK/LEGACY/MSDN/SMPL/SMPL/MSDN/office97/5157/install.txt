System Requirements for the use of Microsoft Word Viewer 

 - A personal computer with a 386 or higher processor
 - MS-DOS® operating system version 3.x or later
 - Microsoft Windows®  16-bit operating system version 3.1 or later
 - 4 MB of memory for Windows 16-bit operating systems (6 MB recommended)

To install Word Viewer, you must have the file WDVW9716.EXE on your LAN or local hard drive, (or one of 
the alternate file sets described in this document under "Distribution of Word Viewer"). Close all other 
applications and ensure that you are not running any utilities or virus protection programs. In Windows 
File Manager, double-click WDVW9716.EXE. This will run an unpack utility that extracts the Word Viewer 
distribution files and starts the Word Viewer Setup program. Follow these instructions to successfully 
complete the installation.

1. Installation of Word Viewer is designed to take place from within Microsoft Windows. If Windows is not 
running, please start it before continuing. Make sure to close all applications first, and make sure you 
are not running any utilities or virus protection before proceeding. It is very important that your computer
runs under a Windows 16-bit operating system in order to install this version of Word Viewer. The Setup 
application for Word Viewer prevents you from installing Word Viewer in a 32-bit operating system like 
Windows 95 or Windows NT®. A 32-bit version of Word Viewer 97 is also available.

2. If you have installed Word Viewer from a prior beta, you should first uninstall that version before 
installing this one. For directions on uninstall, consult the ReadMe.doc file included with the prior 
version of Word Viewer.

3. Your starting point for Word Viewer installation depends upon whether you download the Viewer from the 
Microsoft Web site or an online service, or receive it on disks.

(a) If you download WDVW9716.EXE and choose to run it, the file will unpack itself. You can also save the 
file to a local folder and run WDVW9716.EXE later. After unpacking the contents of WDVW9716.EXE you will have 
to start the Word Viewer Setup program (setup.exe) in order to continue the installation of Microsoft Word Viewer.

(b) If you received Word Viewer on disks, insert the disk labeled as disk 1 into your floppy drive. In 
Program Manager, on the File menu, click "Run." Type "a:setup".

4. Word Viewer Setup will prompt you for a folder in which to install Word Viewer or you can simply accept 
the suggested default location. The default folder location for Word Viewer is C:\WORDVIEW.

5. After choosing the folder location for Word Viewer, continue through setup and click "Install" to install
Word Viewer.

6. If Word Viewer Setup detects Word for Windows version 6.x on your system, it will prompt you to 
determine which application should open Word documents by default. 

Important:

	- Choosing "Open with Word" means that Word will be used by default to open Word files. 
	- Choosing "Open with Viewer" means that Word Viewer will be used by default to open Word files. 
	  
Note: 

	If you select the "Open with Viewer" option and you want to restore Word as the default 
	document handler, you will have to uninstall Word Viewer and reinstall Word so that it can restore 
        its document handling information. 

7. To run Word Viewer, in File Manager, double-click on the WordView.exe file. You can also double-click on 
the Word Viewer icon in Program Manager. For additional information on using Word Viewer, see Readme.doc 
located in the same directory as Word Viewer. To view this file, run Word Viewer.

In the "Open" dialog box, click Readme.doc, and then click OK. If The "Open" dialog box is not pointing to 
your WORDVIEW folder when you start Word Viewer, change to that folder and open Readme.doc.

If you plan to distribute Word Viewer, either online or on disks, you will need WDVW9716.EXE or the files it
unpacks.
