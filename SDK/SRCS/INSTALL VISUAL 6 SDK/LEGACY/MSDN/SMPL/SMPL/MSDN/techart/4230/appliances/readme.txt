AppWizard has created this APPLIANCES DLL for you.  This DLL not only
demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classes but
is also a starting point for writing your DLL.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your APPLIANCES DLL.


APPLIANCES.MAK
    This project file is compatible with the Visual C++ development
	environment. 

    It is also compatible with the NMAKE program provided with Visual C++. 

    To build a debug version of the program from the MS-DOS prompt, type
nmake /f APPLIANCES.MAK CFG="Win32 Debug"
    or to build a release version of the program, type
nmake /f APPLIANCES.MAK CFG="Win32 Release"

APPLIANCES.H
	This is the main header file for the DLL.  It declares the
	CAppliancesApp class.

APPLIANCES.CPP

	It also contains the OLE entry points required of inproc servers.

APPLIANCES.ODL
    This file contains the Object Description Language source code for the
    type library of your DLL.

APPLIANCES.RC
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in the
    Visual C++ development environment.

RES\APPLIANCES.RC2

Other standard files:

STDAFX.H, STDAFX.CPP
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named APPLIANCES.PCH and a precompiled types file named STDAFX.OBJ.
