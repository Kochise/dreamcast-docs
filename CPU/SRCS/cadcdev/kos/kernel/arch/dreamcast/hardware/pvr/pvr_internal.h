/**** State stuff ***************************************************/

/* The internal workings of the PVR2 are quite complex, and thank goodness
   we have the TA to help us with this setup process for each frame, or
   it'd be a LOT more work!

   Basically you have three different sets of buffers while registering
   scene data:

   1) Vertex buffer: this is a PVR RAM buffer that holds processed vertex
      data as it is fed to the TA
   2) Object pointer buffer: this is essentially an array of lists which
      holds data about which objects appear may appear in which tiles; for
      some odd reason, it grows down (probably so you don't have to pre-size
      vertex and OPB buffers, kinda like heap and stack)
   3) Tile matrix: this has a fixed-size entry for each tile on that will
      be rendered to; each active list must have a pointer into the OPB,
      or an "end of list" marker to mark it as have no OPB space

   As the TA collects data, the buffers may start to overflow if you have
   a lot of polygons, and that's what the grow space is about. It is
   initially using a fairly small amount of PVR RAM to hold the data
   structures, but as it overflows the bins for each tile, it must 
   allocate a new block.

   3D processing proceeds in a pipeline fashion. There are four functional
   units we have to consider in this process: the main CPU, the tile
   accelerator, the ISP/TSP, and the visual output.

   If vertex DMA is enabled, then the TA may optionally be fed by the CPU,
   which will free it up from stalls that may happen with certain polygons
   when feeding the TA, as well as enabling other benefits.

   So in an ideal situation with no DMA enabled, it looks like this:

   VBlanks	SH4-to-TA	ISP/TSP			View
   0		->T0		-			-
   1		->T1		T0->F0			-
   2		->T0		T1->F1			F0
   3		->T1		T0->F0			F1
   ...

   When vertex DMA is enabled, we go into a naive 3-stage setup. This can
   be improved later, but it's a start for now.

   In this mode, we augment the timing diagram above:

   VBlanks	SH4-to-RAM	DMA-to-TA	ISP/TSP			View
   0		->R0		-		-			-
   1		->R1		R0->T0		-			-
   2		->R0		R1->T1		T0->F0			-
   3		->R1		R0->T0		T1->F1			F0
   4		->R0		R1->T1		T0->F0			F1
   ...

   In the current naive implementation, everything is timed off of vblank
   interrupts. So the program can write vertices to the RAM buffers as long
   as it wants. On the first vblank where the current RAM buffers are filled
   up, DMA proceeds from the filled buffer to the TA. On the first vblank
   where all the TA transfers have completed, ISP/TSP rendering is started.
   On the first vblank where a frame has been completed, the view is switched
   to the frame. Thus everything sort of cascades in natural order when it's
   ready. This also solves the issue in previous versions where one would
   write a single frame and it'd never show up unless you push through
   several more frames. For example, a single frame written would look
   like this:

   VBlanks	SH4-to-RAM	DMA-to-TA	ISP/TSP			View
   0		->R0		-		-			-
   1		-		R0->T0		-			-
   2		-		-		T0->F0			-
   3		-		-		-			F0

   Another example, if the CPU spent more than 16msec generating data in the
   SH4-to-RAM phase, it might look like this at 30fps:

   VBlanks	SH4-to-RAM	DMA-to-TA	ISP/TSP			View
   0		->R0		-		-			-
   1		-		R0->T0		-			-
   2		->R1		-		T0->F0			-
   3		-		R1->T1		-			F0
   4		->R0		-		T1->F1			F0
   5		-		R0->T0		-			F1
   6		->R1		-		T0->F0			F1
   ...

   Note that in the case where the potentially bigger frames cause the DMA-to-TA
   or ISP/TSP phases to take longer than one frame, they are allowed to expand
   into the next slot gracefully.
