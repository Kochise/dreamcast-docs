-----------------------------------------
This library is based on libogg and libvorbis by xiphophorus.org.
Written in 2001/2002 by Thorsten Titze <thorsten.titze@hangar-eleven.de>

Compile tested under KallistiOS-1.1.6 (CVS)

This directory contains all sources needed to compile the KallistiOS 
Ogg/Vorbis player library. Here is a list of the directories contents :

include : includes needed for the compilation of libogg and libvorbis
lib : the Makefile places the finished libraries here
liboggvorbis : the sourcetrees for Xiph's libogg and libvorbis
liboggvorbisplay : the sources for the sndoggvorbis player library

Compilation and Installation:
-----------------------------

Type "make" in liboggvorbis directory the library should be compiled and copied
to your $KOS_BASE/lib directory.

You may do a "make clean" in the root of the liboggvorbis directory to clean
up the space that has been used during compilation. The compiled library and
needed header file are already residing in your $KOS_BASE/lib and
$KOS_BASE/include directories.

Now you may compile the "$KOS_BASE/examples/dreamcast/hello_ogg" example or
the "$KOS_BASE/examples/dreamcast/ghettoplay-vorbis" to see if your
environment is working.

Installed Libraries:
--------------------

the original libraries can be used.

liboggvorbisplay.a (<oggvorbis/sndoggvorbis.h>):

method of usage in programs !
