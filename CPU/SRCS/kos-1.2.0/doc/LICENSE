KallistiOS licensing information


NOTE: The licensing terms have CHANGED since 0.7! Please read over this
document again if you read the one for 0.7.

More like previous projects (libdream, s3mplay, etc), KallistiOS is licensed
under the terms of the *new* BSD license. We are calling our version of this
license with the KOS copyright notice the "KOS License". For all files that
are copyrighted by the authors of KallistiOS (Dan Potter, etc), or for any
file which does not otherwise specify (and does not come from a third-party
package like newlib), you can assume that this text is attached to them:

 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the KOS License.

 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
 KOS License (README.KOS) for more details.

 You should have received a copy of the KOS License along with this
 program; if not, please visit Cryptic Allusion DCDev at:

   http://dcdev.allusion.net/

Please read "README.KOS" for the full details.

If there is ever a question or you want to ask permission to do something
else with it, please contact the authors and we'll see how we can accomidate
you.

The Free Software Foundation has a very good source of information on
the various licenses. Please see this page if you have license compatability
questions:

http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html

All of that applies only to the part of KOS that is copyrighted by the
authors, which is to say, not the BSD code we included. For information
on the BSD code, please reference README.BSD. Be aware, though, that
the BSD license is basically identical, but ours has been cleaned up (the
"advertising clause" is gone completely).

KOS also contains code from the "lwIP" TCP/IP stack, copyright 2001
Swedish Institute of Computer Science. This code is licensed under a
license basically identical to the KOS license, but with their name.
You can find the license in any of their files.

One final note: some of the software included with the KOS distribution
is not copyrighted by us, nor is it part of the codebase of KOS. Pretty
much all of that code is contained in the "utils" directory, and will
shortly be contained as well (or perhaps only) in the "addons"
directory. Licenses on these pieces vary; please see the source of the
program in question to be sure. In particular, genromfs, dialog, and the
XingMP3 library (in addons/libmp3/xingmp3) are covered under the GPL, and
MPGLIB (in addons/libmp3/mpglib) is covered under the LGPL. I don't yell
lightly, so pay attention to this:

IF YOU USE THE XINGMP3 LIBRARY IN YOUR PROGRAM, YOUR PROGRAM
AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES RESTRICTED BY THE GPL LICENSE. IF YOU USE THE
XINGMP3 LIBRARY IN YOUR PROGRAM, YOU MAY NOT DISTRIBUTE IT WITHOUT
SOURCE CODE. END.

Just in case you missed that or don't like caps, you may not include the
Xing MP3 library in your program (this currently means linking -lmp3
from the KOS addons tree) without making your program GPL'd, or
something less restrictive (e.g., BSD license) but distributing it by
the terms of the GPL. If you replace the MP3 engine, however, you _can_
do this, as all of our libmp3 code is covered under the BSD license.

There. I've said my piece =). Now if you break the license, it's your
fault.

I am currently working on porting the MPGLIB library from the unix
player 'mpg123', but this isn't complete yet. I included the code so far
but it doesn't work properly. If you want to play with it then email me
for the changes to libmp3 that are required to hook into it.

Also:

This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
Group (see addons/libjpeg/README).
